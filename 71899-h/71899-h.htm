<div><span class='pageno' title='1' id='Page_1'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-THIRD DAY</span><br/> Tuesday, 25 June 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Von Neurath resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO NELTE (Counsel for Defendant Keitel): Mr. President,
I should like to advise the Tribunal that the first half of the
manuscript of my final defense speech in typescript will be ready
tomorrow and the second half by next Saturday. I am sorry to say
that I personally can furnish only eight copies, six of which are
earmarked for the interpreters to facilitate their difficult task. I
am sorry that I could not furnish more copies since I personally
have no mimeographing machine. I hope the Tribunal will appreciate
the fact that after the statement made by the chief prosecutor
for the United States on Friday, I cannot make any claims on the
technical assistance of the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I am asking the Tribunal to decide whether it would
be worth while, in order to expedite the presentation, to have the
translation of my speech put before them. In this event I would
request that the necessary arrangements be made. I am prepared
to place my manuscript at the disposal of the Tribunal, under the
conditions announced by you, Mr. President. What applies for me
personally would, so far as I am advised, apply also for the rest, at
least for the majority of Defense Counsel. In order to expedite the
proceedings and to reduce the time spent on the presentation of the
final defense speeches, it is important to have this point clarified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, if you would hand in the manuscript
to which you have referred, the Tribunal will make arrangements
to have it translated into the various languages. I think that
will meet the position so far as you are concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has an announcement upon the
subject, which I am about to read. The announcement is this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In view of the discussion which took place on the 13th of
June 1946, on the question of time to be taken by Defense
Counsel, the Tribunal has given the matter further consideration.
<span class='pageno' title='2' id='Page_2'></span></p>

<p>“When the Defense Counsel stated the time they wished to
take, the Tribunal observed that some of the defendants
required more time than others, and to this extent they did
make an apportionment among themselves. The Tribunal
feels that the suggested times are much too long and some
voluntary restriction should be made.</p>

<p>“Except as to a few of the defendants whose cases are of very
wide scope, the Tribunal is of the opinion that half a day to
each defendant is ample time for the presentation of his
defense; and the Tribunal hopes that counsel will condense
their arguments and limit themselves voluntarily to this time.
The Tribunal, however, will not permit counsel for any
defendant to deal with irrelevant matters or to speak for
more than one day in any case. Four hours will be allowed
at the beginning for argument on the general questions of
law and fact, and counsel should co-operate in their arguments
in such a way as to avoid needless repetition.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As heretofore stated, the Tribunal would like to have a translation
of each argument in French, Russian, and English submitted
at the beginning of the argument. Counsel may arrange for the
translation themselves if they so desire; but if they will submit
copies of their arguments to the translating department as soon as
possible and not less than 3 days in advance of delivery, the translation
will be made for them and the contents of the copies will not
be disclosed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Dr. Lüdinghausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO FREIHERR VON LÜDINGHAUSEN (Counsel for
Defendant Von Neurath): Last night we had stopped in our treatment
of the various points raised by the Prosecution. I should like
to continue now and to put the following question to you, Herr
Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution is charging you with the fact that in the Protectorate
Germans had a preferential position as compared with Czechs
and that you were responsible for that. Will you please comment
on this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>CONSTANTIN VON NEURATH (Defendant): The position of
Germans in the Protectorate was not a preferential position which
was vested with any real preferences and advantages as compared
with the Czechs, but it was an entirely different position. The
Germans had become citizens of the Reich and, therefore, had the
rights of Reich citizens, such as the right to vote in Reichstag
elections. The Czechs did not have this right to vote, which is
understandable in view of the existing difference—variance between
<span class='pageno' title='3' id='Page_3'></span>
the German people and the Czech people. There were at no time
any actual advantages connected with the position of the Germans
in the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Efforts to have preferential treatment were made, of course, in
the chauvinistic Party and in nationalist circles. But I always
opposed them vigorously and prevented any practical realization
of such efforts. In this connection, however, I should like to stress
once more that the Czech people did not consider themselves inferior
to the German people in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a question simply of a different people which had to be
treated, politically and culturally, according to its own characteristics.
That was also the reason for the maintenance of the so-called
autonomy which meant nothing more than the separation of
the two nationalities with a view toward securing for the Czechs
their own way of living; and it is evident that this autonomy had
to be kept within certain limits, dictated by the prevailing necessities
of the Reich as a whole, especially in times of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now, I should like to deal with
the individual points raised in the Czech indictment, or rather the
points found in the Czech report, which is the basis for this charge.
In this report it is asserted that the freedom of the press was suppressed
Is that correct and what role did Herr Von Gregory play
in the treatment of the press?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Herr Von Gregory had been the press attaché
at the German Legation in Prague and was subordinate to the
Propaganda Ministry. Then he came, as chief of my press department,
to my administration and controlled the Czech press according
to the directives of the Propaganda Ministry in Berlin. The
Czech press, of course, was not free—no more than the German
press. Control of circulation and other measures, especially censorship
measures, were the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech report further raises
the charge that the local Czech administrative offices were in many
cases dissolved and then reorganized and key positions filled with
officials and town councillors who were German or Czech collaborators.
Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: These were communities with a considerable
German minority, particularly in Moravia. That they should also
have a representation in the local administration seemed to me a
natural thing. Prague, for instance, had a Czech mayor and a
German assistant mayor. This could hardly be objected to. With
regard to the attempts of the Germans in the various cities or
districts to take a part in the local administration to an extent that
did not seem justified by their numerical strength, I intervened and
<span class='pageno' title='4' id='Page_4'></span>
rejected them. In the municipal administrations of purely Czech
districts, such as in West Bohemia, there were generally no German
representatives at all. But on the other hand, there were German-speaking
enclaves, such as the region of Iglau, where the Germans
were dominant in numbers and thus, of course, in influence as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech report accuses you of
having—in this way and through the appointment of higher land
councillors (Oberlandräte)—germanized the Czech administration,
and this report bases its accusations on a statement which you
allegedly made to the former Bohemian Landespräsident, Bienert,
in which you said, “All that has to be digested in 2 years time.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not recall having made such a statement.
And I cannot imagine having uttered it. Here we are concerned
with the co-ordination of the Czechs—of the Czech with the German
administration. The Oberlandräte were not appointed by me, but
their office was created as a controlling agency by the Reich Government
by the decree of 1 September 1939 in connection with the
setting up of German administrations and the Security Police. When
the Oberlandräte appeared before me to give their reports, I told
them time and again that they were not to do any administrative
work themselves but were to supervise only. The Czech method of
administration was frequently superior to the German, I told them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: With regard to this I should like
to refer to Document Number Neurath-149 of my document book,
the decree on the organization of the administration and the German
Security Police, dated 1 September 1939. In Paragraphs 5 and 6
the appointment and the duties of these Oberlandräte are described
more in detail. A quotation of this document might be redundant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Czech indictment further contains a statement by Herr
Bienert to the effect that on the problem of the co-ordination of the
Czech administration you had remarked to him something like:
“That must be carried out strictly; after all, this is war.” At the
same time Bienert stated in his interrogation that the purpose of
this measure, that is, the co-ordination of the Czech and the German
administration, had been to assure Germany of a peaceful hinterland
during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you kindly also comment on this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: It is possible that I told Bienert something
along these lines. However, I cannot remember it at this date. But
it can be taken for granted that in the sphere of administration, as
in every other sphere in the Protectorate also, the necessities of war
were the main concern. Restrictions of the autonomy in the Czech
national administration have to be considered from this point of
<span class='pageno' title='5' id='Page_5'></span>
view. That it was my constant endeavor to keep the country quiet
in the interest of the Reich, and therewith in the interest of all, can
hardly be held against me. Apart from that, I should like to remark
that the introduction of restrictions on the autonomy was already
contained explicitly in the decree setting up the Protectorate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In this connection I should like to
refer to the order contained in my document book under Number
Neurath-144, Document Book Number 5. The order was issued by
the Führer and Reich Chancellor on the Protectorate of Bohemia
and Moravia and is dated 16 March 1939. Under Article 11 it was
even then stipulated that the Reich could incorporate departments
of the administration of the Protectorate into their own administration.
The Czech report further refers to a statement made by
the former Czech Minister Havelka dealing with the persecution of
the members of the Czech Legion of the first World War insofar as
they held public office. What can you tell us about this question of
the Legionnaires?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The Czech Legion had been founded in Russia
during the first World War. It was composed partially of volunteers,
partially of the balance of Czech regiments which had belonged to
the old Austro-Hungarian Army and had become prisoners of war
in Russia. These Czech Legionnaires enjoyed a certain exceptional
position after the founding of the Czech Republic. In part they
were filled with strong chauvinistic resentment toward the Reich
which dated back to the time of the nationalities fights. This, the
so-called Legionnaire mentality, was a catchword in Bohemia; and
in times of political unrest it could signify a certain political danger.
By the way, this preferential position which the Legionnaires
enjoyed was widely attacked in the Protectorate by the Czechs
themselves. Therefore an effort was made, and by Frank particularly,
to remove the Legionnaires from public office. But this took
place only in the crassest cases and only insofar as those Legionnaires
had joined the Czech Legion voluntarily, that is, it did not
apply to those who were members of the former Austro-Hungarian
Army. From the very beginning I tried to make this discrimination,
which approximately corresponds to the situation—or corresponds
with the distinction—which today is made in Germany between the
voluntary members of the SS and the Waffen-SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech indictment is further
accusing you of having supported the Czech Fascist organization
Vlayka. It bases this charge on a memorandum which you yourself
wrote concerning a discussion which you had with Hacha, the President
of Czechoslovakia, on 26 March 1940. According to this memorandum
you told Hacha that the personal and moral qualities of the
Vlayka leaders were well known to you; in any case, you had to
<span class='pageno' title='6' id='Page_6'></span>
confirm the fact that this movement, this organization, was the only
one which had taken a positive stand toward the Reich and toward
collaboration with the Reich. How about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The Vlayka movement was the same as the
collaborationists in France. This movement worked to bring about
a German-Czech collaboration and, in fact, long before the Protectorate
was established. But the leaders of this movement were,
in my opinion, rather dubious characters, as I showed in the words
to Hacha quoted above. These leaders threatened and slandered
President Hacha and members of the Czech Government among
others. State Secretary Frank had known these men from former
times and he wanted to support them merely in consideration of
their former co-operation with him. However, I refused to do this,
just as I refused the various applications of these people to visit me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, it is possible that Frank supported them
from a fund which Hitler had placed at his disposal without my
knowledge and about which Frank was under obligation not to tell
me anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What attitude, now, did you take
to the dissolution of parties—of political parties—and of trade
unions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That was like the control of the press, a
necessity which resulted from the system, from the political system
of the Reich. In any event, through this step taken by President
Hacha and despite the measures taken by Germany, no country
suffered less from the war than the Protectorate. The Czech people
were the only ones in middle and eastern Europe who could retain
their national, cultural, and economic entity almost to its full
extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now I should like to turn to the
point raised by the Prosecution which is concerned with an alleged
cultural suppression. What can you tell us about the handling of
Czech educational affairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The Czech universities and other institutions
of higher education, as has been stated before, were closed at Hitler’s
order in November 1939. Again and again, at the request of President
Hacha and of the Protectorate Government, I appealed directly
to Hitler to have these schools reopened. But due to the dominating
position of Herr Himmler, I had no success. The consequence of the
closing of the universities, of course, was that a large number of
young people who otherwise would have become university students
now had to look for work of a manual sort. The closing of the
institutions of higher learning also had repercussions on the secondary
school level. This had already been heavily burdened after the
<span class='pageno' title='7' id='Page_7'></span>
separation of the Sudetenland in the autumn of 1938, for the entire
Czech intelligentsia from this region had returned to the Czech-speaking
area, or what was later the Protectorate. Hence for the
young people from the secondary schools there was hardly any
employment left. It was about the same situation which is now
prevailing in Germany. Concerning the closing of Czech lower
schools and other planned efforts to restrict Czech youth in their
cultural freedom and their educational possibilities, I know nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did you yourself approve of the
closing of Czech institutions of higher learning ordered by Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, he said that he tried
to intervene and get rid of Hitler’s order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: If that is sufficient for the Tribunal
then he need not answer the question further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Don’t you think that is sufficient?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, I just wanted to have it expressed
once again in a somewhat stronger way; however, if the
Tribunal is satisfied with the clarification of this problem, I am
completely satisfied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It would not make it any better if it was said
twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, if you—but, it is sufficient.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Do you know anything about an
alleged plan, mentioned in the Czech report, to turn the Czech people
into a mass of workers and to rob them of their intellectual elite?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. Only a madman could have made a statement
like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech indictment, or report,
asserts that through your agencies, that is, with your consent and
endorsement, destruction and plundering of Czech scientific institutions
took place. On Page 58 of the German text, Page 55 of the
English of this report, USSR-60, it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Germans occupied all universities and scientific institutions.
They immediately got hold of the valuable apparatus,
instruments, and scientific installations in the occupied
institutions. The scientific libraries were plundered systematically
and methodically. Scientific books and films were torn
up or taken away. The archives of the academic Senate, the
highest university authority, were torn up or burned; and the
card indexes destroyed and scattered to the four winds.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What can you tell us in regard to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In this connection, I can say only that I never
heard of any plundering and destruction of the sort described either
<span class='pageno' title='8' id='Page_8'></span>
in Prague or later. The Czech Hochschulen, or institutions of higher
education, were closed together with the universities in the year
1939 at Hitler’s order. The buildings and installations of the Prague
Czech University, as far as I know, were partly put at the disposal
of the German university which had been closed earlier by the
Czechs, since, after the Czech Hochschulen were closed, they could
not be used any longer for Czech scientific purposes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything at all about
this...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I did not understand that answer. As I got it,
“The buildings, in part, were put at the disposal of German
universities which had been closed by the Czechs.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In Prague. In Prague was the oldest German
university; it had been closed by the Czechs after the last war, and
after the establishing of the Protectorate it was reopened; and, as
far as I know, some of the equipment and buildings were used for
this German university.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything else about
the removal of scientific equipment, collections, objects of art, and
so forth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The only case about which I have any knowledge
concerned the removal of historically valuable old Gobelins
from the Maltese Palace in Prague. These were removed by a
member of the Foreign Office in Berlin, allegedly by order of the
chief of protocol; and this was done at night, secretly, and without
my knowledge or the knowledge of my officials. As soon as I learned
of this I contacted the Foreign Office, and I requested immediate
restoration. Whether restoration was made, I do not know; that was
only in 1941, and meanwhile I had left Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: May I here...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I know nothing about other incidents. Apart
from that, I specifically prohibited the removal of art objects from
the Protectorate to the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In this connection, I should like to
submit an extract from the interrogation of the former State Secretary
Frank, dated 10 June 1945. This is Number Neurath-154 of my
Document Book Number 5, and I should like to ask the Tribunal to
take notice of this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] What happened to the objects of art
and the furniture, which were Czech State property and with which
the Czernin Palace in Prague, which you used as your official
residence, was furnished?
<span class='pageno' title='9' id='Page_9'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: This house was the former official residence of
the Czech Foreign Minister, and the partly valuable furnishings
belonged to the Czech State. Since there was no inventory of any
sort of these items, before moving in in the fall of 1939, I called in
the Czech director of the castle administration and the Czech art
historian, Professor Strecki; and I had a very exact inventory taken.
One copy of this inventory was left in my office and another one
was deposited with the administration of the castle. After I left
Prague in the autumn of 1941, I had a record made through my
former caretaker and again in the presence of a representative of
the castle administration, Professor Strecki, that the articles which
were mentioned in the inventory were actually still there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I don’t think we need details of the inventory,
but there is one thing I should like to ask. The translation came
through to me that the inventory was made in the fall of 1938. Was
that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: 1939. I only wanted to mention that naturally
I did not take any of these articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Another point raised by the Czech
indictment deals with the confiscation of the so-called Masaryk
houses in various cities and with the destruction of Masaryk monuments
and monuments erected to other personalities famous in Czech
history. What do you know about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: While I was in office, some of these Masaryk
houses were closed by the Police because they were centers of
agitation against Germany. The destruction or the removal of
Masaryk or other Czech national monuments I had specifically prohibited.
Apart from that, I expressly permitted the laying of wreaths
at the grave of Masaryk at Lanyi, which Frank had prohibited, and
this actually took place on a large scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: It is further asserted that Czech
literature was suppressed and muzzled to a large extent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The printing and dissemination of Czech anti-German
literature was prohibited of course, just as the further
dissemination of English and French works was prohibited in the
entire Reich during the war. Aside from that, all this material was
treated according to the direct orders of the Propaganda Ministry.
However, while I was in office, there were still many Czech book
stores and book-publishing concerns which published books by
Czech authors in large numbers and disseminated them. The selection
of Czech books of every type in the book stores was considerably
larger than the selection of German books.
<span class='pageno' title='10' id='Page_10'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Could you say anything about the
suppression of Czech cultural life, of theaters, movies, and so forth,
to which the Prosecution refers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: There was no question at all of a limitation of
the cultural autonomy of the Czechs, aside from the university
problem. In Prague a great number of large Czech theaters of every
description were open all the time, especially the Czech opera and
several theaters. On the other hand there was only one permanent
German theater with daily performances. There was a constant
production of many Czech plays and operas, and the same applied
to music. The well-known Czech Philharmonic Orchestra at Prague
played Czech music primarily and was absolutely independent
regarding its programs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Lüdinghausen, we don’t need details. The
defendant says that theaters and cinema theaters were allowed and
there was only one German theater. We don’t want any further
details about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LÜDINGHAUSEN: Very well, Mr. President. I asked about
these matters only because they are rather extensively dealt with in
the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] And what about the film industry,
Herr Von Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The same applied to the movie industry. It
was even especially active.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now, I should like to turn to the
alleged suppression of religious freedom, of which you are being
accused in the Czech indictment. The Czech indictment speaks of
a wave of persecution which inundated the churches and which
started immediately when the German troops marched in to occupy
the country. What about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: A systematic persecution of the churches is
quite out of the question. The population was quite free as concerns
public worship, and I certainly would not have tolerated any
restrictions along this line. The former Under State Secretary
Von Burgsdorff has testified to that point here already. It may be
true that in individual cases pilgrimages or certain religious processions
were prohibited by the Police, even though I personally do not
remember it clearly. But that took place only because certain pilgrimages,
consisting of many thousands of people, were exploited
as political demonstrations at which anti-German speeches were
made. At any rate, that had actually occurred several times and
had been brought to my knowledge. It is true that a number of
clerics were arrested in connection with the action at the beginning
of the war, which we have already mentioned here. But these
<span class='pageno' title='11' id='Page_11'></span>
arrests did not take place, because the men were clerics but because
they were active political opponents or people who were political
suspects. In cases of this nature I made special efforts to have these
people released.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My personal connections with the archbishop of Prague were
absolutely correct and amicable. He and the archbishop of Olmütz
specifically thanked me for my intervention on behalf of the Church,
as I remember distinctly. I prevented any measure against the
public worship of the Jews. Every synagogue was open to the time
I left in the autumn of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In connection with the last point,
I should like to put one more question about the position of Jews
in the Protectorate. What can you tell us about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The legal position of the Jews had to be co-ordinated
with the position of the Jews in the Reich, according to
instructions from Berlin. The directives with regard to this had
been sent to me already in April of 1939. Through all sorts of
inquiries addressed to Berlin, I tried and succeeded in not having
the laws go into effect until June 1939, so as to give the Jews the
opportunity to prepare themselves for the imminent introduction of
these laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The so-called Nuremberg Laws were introduced into the Protectorate,
too, at that time. Thereby the Jews were removed from
public life and from leading positions in the economic life. However,
arrests on a large scale did not take place. There were also no
excesses against Jews, except in a few single instances. The camp
at Theresienstadt was not erected until long after my time of office,
and I prevented the erection of other concentration camps in the
Protectorate, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech report accuses you of
personally carrying through anti-Jewish measures. They maintain
that, first of all, you charged the Czech Government, that is to
say the autonomous government, with the carrying through of the
anti-Jewish laws and that when Ministerpräsident Elias refused to
do so, you personally took the necessary steps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: As I said just now, the introduction of the
anti-Jewish laws came about on Hitler’s direct order, that is to say
through the competent authorities in Berlin. The representation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, why do you want to
go over all this again? The defendant has given the evidence that he
succeeded in putting off the laws until June 1939 and that then the
Nuremberg Laws were introduced. He has given us the various
qualifications which he said he made; and then you read him the
<span class='pageno' title='12' id='Page_12'></span>
Czech report and try to get him to go over it all again, it seems to
me. It is now quarter past 11.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: All right, then, I shall consider the
first question sufficiently answered and we shall not deal with the
matter of confiscation either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Czech report further accuses
you of the dissolution of the organizations of the YMCA and YWCA,
and the confiscation of their property in favor of German organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I must admit that I do not recall these confiscations
at all. If this dissolution and confiscation took place before
I left, it must have been a police measure only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech report further mentions
the destruction of Czech economic life and the systematic plundering
of Czech stocks of raw materials and accuses you in that
regard. What are the facts with regard to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: With the establishment of the Protectorate, the
Czech economy almost automatically was incorporated into the German
economy. The export trade, for which Czech industries had
worked to a considerable degree, was stopped for the duration of
the war, that is to say, it had to trade with the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Czech heavy industries, especially the Skoda Works and the
arms industry, as direct war industries, were taken over to supplement
German armaments production by the Delegate for the Four
Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning I tried especially to avoid selling out of the
Protectorate, which would have been hard on the population. An
effective means for that purpose was the maintenance of the customs
boundaries which existed between Czechoslovakia and Germany.
After heated conflicts with the Berlin economic departments, I succeeded
in having the customs barrier maintained up to October 1940,
for another year and a half, though it had already been rescinded
on 16 March 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe I am also accused of having been responsible for the
removal of raw materials and the like. In that connection I should
like to say that the office of the Delegate for the Four Year Plan
was the only authority which could take such measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In this connection I should like to
refer to the decree which has already been submitted, the decree
dated 16 March 1939, Number Neurath-144 of my Document Book
Number 5. In this decree I should like to call special attention to
Articles 9 and 10.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You are further charged with and
accused of the fact that the rate of exchange of Czech kronen to
<span class='pageno' title='13' id='Page_13'></span>
marks was established as 10 to 1, for in this way the buying out of
Czechoslovakian goods was said to have been favored. Are you
responsible for the establishing of this rate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. In the decree of 16 March 1939 dealing
with the establishment of the Protectorate—a decree in the drafting
of which I did not take part in any way—it was already stipulated
that the rate of exchange would be determined by the Reich Government.
As far as I know, the same rate was the customary one at the
stock exchange and in trade before the incorporation of the Sudetenland
into the Reich as well as afterwards. An official rate had to be
determined, of course, and this was done through the decree issued
by the authorities in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In connection with the decree
dated 16 March 1939, which was just mentioned and which is to be
found under Number Neurath-144 of my Document Book Number 5,
I should like to call your attention especially to Article 10 which
sets forth: “The ratio of the two currencies, the Czechoslovakian and
the German, to each other will be determined by the Reich Government.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Czech report further accuses you
of the fact that railroad rails allegedly were removed and taken to
Germany. Do you know anything about this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I know nothing about this matter and I think
this is certainly an error. I know only that in the year 1940 there
were negotiations between the German Reich railroads and the
Czech State railroads concerning the borrowing of railroad cars and
of engines against remuneration. But the stipulation in this case
was that this rolling stock could be spared by the transport system
in the Protectorate. Aside from that, the railroads in the Protectorate,
were not under my supervision; but they were directly
subordinate to the Transportation Ministry in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I should like to refer to Article 8
of the decree which I have just mentioned, a decree which is found
under Number Neurath-144 of my Document Book 5.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] It is further asserted that the Reich
Commissioner at the Prague National Bank stopped all payments
for abroad and confiscated all the stocks of gold and of foreign
currencies of the National Bank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you have anything to do with this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I had nothing at all to do with these matters.
The Reich Commissioner for the Prague National Bank was appointed
directly by the Reichsbank in Berlin, or rather by the Ministry
of Finance; and he got his orders from them.
<span class='pageno' title='14' id='Page_14'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Czech report states further
that you are to be blamed, or are to be made co-responsible, for the
alleged confiscation of the Czech banks and industrial undertakings
by the German economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The German banks, and to an extent the German
industries as well, had a real interest in getting a firm foothold
in the economic life of the Protectorate. However, this was
something which applied long before the establishment of the Protectorate.
Therefore it was not strange that the big German banks,
in particular, used the opportunity to acquire Czech stocks and
securities; and in this way the controlling interest in two Czech
banks together with their industrial holdings were transferred to
German hands in a manner which was economically quite correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe the Union Bank is mentioned in the Czech report, a
bank which was taken over by the Deutsche Bank; and I know in
this case quite coincidentally that the initiative did not originate on
the German side, but rather from the Czech Union Bank itself. But
neither I nor my agencies tried to foster this development in any
way. Apart from that all these enterprises had Czech general
directors, and in very few cases were German officials taken in. By
far the largest part of all industrial enterprises remained purely
Czech as before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was the situation with regard
to the alleged coercive measures which the Prosecution maintains
were used against Czech agriculture? Can you tell something about
this and about your attitude and the measures you took?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: This chapter belongs to the whole scheme of
plans by the Party and SS, relative to Germanization, which have
already been mentioned. The instrument of this German settlement
policy was to be the Czech Land Office (Bodenamt), which in itself
was a Czech office, which was a survival of the former Czech office
for agrarian reform. Himmler first of all assigned to the Land
Office an SS Führer as its provisional leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not want to know all the
details about this. The Czech report apparently alleges coercion in
agriculture. The defendant says that it was due, if any, to the Party
and the SS; and he had nothing to do with it. What is the object of
his giving us all these details about the history of agriculture in
Czechoslovakia? You must realize the Tribunal...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, but I should like to point out
one thing only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Land Office, which was acting
in the interests of National Socialism, was restaffed by you with
<span class='pageno' title='15' id='Page_15'></span>
new personnel after a long struggle. I considered it important to
clarify this too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I should like to make a general remark. I said
yesterday that my examination would last another hour. But yesterday,
when I left the session, I found another document book to the
indictment which has forced me to deal in greater detail with
individual questions here. And for this reason, a reason which I
could not foresee, I will have to take additional time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, the Tribunal has not taken up the
question of time at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why do you have to go into some questions of—I do not know
what the word is, “Amt”—to do with agriculture? Why do you want
to go into that? He, the defendant, said he had nothing to do with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, in a way he was connected
with it, Mr. President, insofar as these agricultural efforts were
made through the Land Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If he was connected with it let him explain
it. I thought he said the Party and the SS did it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, but via the Land Office, and
he prevented this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps you can tell us briefly about this, Herr Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I believe that according to the statements of
the President of the Court, that is hardly necessary. As a matter of
fact, I had no direct connection with the Land Office. I only
succeeded in having a rather unpleasant leader of this office, a
member of the SS, removed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: During your period of office as
Reich Protector, was there any compulsory transportation of workers
to the Reich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. In this connection I shall also be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Compulsory labor did not exist at all while I was in the Protectorate.
There was an emergency service law which was issued
by the Protectorate Government and applied to younger men who
were employed in urgently needed work in the public interest in
the Protectorate. Compulsory deportations of workers to the Reich
did not occur in my time. On the contrary, many young people
reported voluntarily for work in Germany, because labor conditions
and wages were better in the Reich than in the Protectorate at that
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: How did your resignation from
office—and this is my last question—your leaving your office as
Reich Protector come about?
<span class='pageno' title='16' id='Page_16'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: First of all I should like to tell you why I
remained as long as I did, in spite of all these occurrences and
difficulties. The reason for it was that I was convinced, and I am
still convinced today, that I had to stay as long as I could reconcile
this with my conscience, in order to prevent this country, which was
entrusted to Germany, from coming under the definite domination
of the SS. Everything that happened to the country after my
departure in 1941 I had actually prevented through my presence;
and even if my work was ever so much limited, I believe that by
remaining I not only rendered a service to my own country but to
the Czech people as well, and under the same circumstances I would
not act differently even today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from this I believed that in time of war, especially, I should
leave such a difficult and responsible office only in case of the
utmost necessity. The crew of a ship does not go below deck and
fold their hands in their laps if the ship is in danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That I could not comply with the wishes of the Czechs 100 percent
is something that will be understood by everybody who had
to deal with politics in a practical and not merely theoretical way.
And so I believe that by my persevering in office I prevented much
of the misery which befell the Czech people after I left. This opinion
was also shared by a large number of the Czech population, as I
could gather from the numerous letters which were addressed to me
by the Czech people later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And how did it happen that you
left, that you resigned from your office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: On 23 September 1941 I received a telephone
call from Hitler asking me to come to headquarters immediately.
There he told me that I was being too mild with the Czechs and that
this state of affairs could not be continued. He told me that he had
decided to adopt severe measures against the Czech resistance
movement and that for this purpose the notorious Obergruppenführer
Heydrich would be sent to Prague. I did everything in my
power to dissuade him from this but was not successful. Thereupon
I asked permission to resign, since I could never be responsible for
any activity of Heydrich’s in Prague. Hitler refused my resignation
but permitted me to go on leave. I flew back to Prague and on the
following day I continued my journey home. At the same hour
that I left Prague, Heydrich arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I wrote to Hitler from my home and again asked to resign
immediately. When in spite of a reminder I did not receive any
answer I repeated my request, and at the same time I explained
that under no circumstances would I return to Prague, that I had
dissolved my office and I refused to act as Reich Protector from now
on. I was not officially relieved from my office until October 1943.
<span class='pageno' title='17' id='Page_17'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I should like to conclude
my examination of the defendant with a brief quotation from
the Czech indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just one moment, was your going on leave
made public?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, I was just going to quote that,
Mr. President. In that text of the Czech indictment it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When at last in the second half of September the underground
Czech revolt committees, with the help of the BBC,
began a successful boycott campaign against the German controlled
press, the German authorities seized the opportunity
to aim a heavy blow at the Czech population. On 27 September
1941 radio station Prague gave out the following report:</p>

<p>“ ‘Reich Minister Baron von Neurath, Reich Protector of
Bohemia and Moravia, has found it necessary to ask the
Führer for a long leave in order to restore his impaired
health.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then in conclusion it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Under these circumstances the Führer agreed to the request
of the Reich Protector and charged SS Obergruppenführer
Heydrich with the direction of the office of Reich Protector of
Bohemia and Moravia during the time of the illness of Reich
Minister Von Neurath.”</p>

</div>

<p>With this my examination is ended, Mr. President.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: From September 1941 until October 1943, did
you live on your own estates, or what?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: My examination is over.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: The Court will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel wish to
ask the witness any questions?</p>

<p>DR. EGON KUBUSCHOK (Counsel for Defendant Von Papen):
Is it known to you that immediately before Germany left the League
of Nations, Von Papen followed Hitler to Munich to persuade him
to remain in the League of Nations?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is known to me. In fact, I myself
induced him to do so.
<span class='pageno' title='18' id='Page_18'></span></p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: During the time he was Vice Chancellor in
1933 and 1934, did Von Papen protest in the Cabinet against
unfriendly acts of the German policy toward Austria, as for
instance, the introduction of the 1,000-mark embargo?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, that line was continuously followed by
him and by other ministers and naturally by myself, too.</p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Did Hitler mention to you that this attitude
of Papen’s in the Austrian problem induced him to transfer the
mission in Vienna to Papen after the murder of Dollfuss?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, Hitler did speak about that.</p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Did Hitler discuss with you the reasons why
he addressed the letter of 26 July 1934 to Papen, announcing that
Papen would be sent to Austria?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, but the way it happened was as follows:
When Hitler told me about his intention to send Papen to Vienna,
I reminded him that, in order to give the latter any weight, he
should first of all, after the events of 30 June, clear up the relationship
between himself, Hitler, and Papen, and clear it up publicly.
This letter which was read here in Court can be traced to that.</p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: In 1937 you paid a visit to the Austrian
Government which led to demonstrations. Were you and Von Papen
surprised by these demonstrations, and did you agree with them?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: The demonstrations were a complete surprise
to me, especially because of their tremendous size. They certainly
did not please me, because they cast a certain shadow on the discussions
between Herr Von Schuschnigg and myself.</p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Then, the last question: Before Schleicher’s
Government was formed there was a meeting of the Cabinet on
2 December 1932. The day before Papen had been given orders by
Hindenburg to send the Parliament on leave and to form a new
government. Is it correct that Papen reported on this matter to the
Cabinet and that Schleicher, as Reichswehrminister, made a statement
to the effect that this would lead to civil war and that the
forces of the Wehrmacht were too weak to cope with such a
civil war?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, I remember this occurrence very accurately.
We were all somewhat surprised at Schleicher’s statement.
However it was so well founded that we had to accept it as true.</p>

<p>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thank you.</p>

<p>THE PRESIDENT: Do any other defendants’ counsel wish to ask
any questions?</p>

<p>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p>The Prosecution?
<span class='pageno' title='19' id='Page_19'></span></p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the
United Kingdom): At the time about which Dr. Kubuschok has just
been asking you, in the second half of 1932, did you know that President
Von Hindenburg, the Defendant Von Papen, and General
Von Schleicher were discussing and considering very hard what
would be the best method of dealing with the Nazi Party?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: No. As I have already testified, I had no connection
in that respect. I knew absolutely nothing about all these
negotiations.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I want to make it clear, I am
not suggesting you were in the negotiations. But didn’t you know
that the problem as to how to deal with the Nazi Party was exercising
the minds of the President and the Defendant Von Papen
and General Von Schleicher; that it was a very urgent problem in
their minds?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, I knew that.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And again, do not think, Defendant,
I am suggesting that you were in the negotiations. You may
take it—well, I will make all the suggestions perfectly
clear.</p>

<p>You knew that in the end the method which commended itself
to President Von Hindenburg, to the Defendant Von Papen, and to
General Von Schleicher was that there should be a government with
Hitler as Chancellor, but well brigaded by conservative elements,
in harness with conservative elements; that was the plan that was
ultimately resolved on? You knew that much, I suppose, didn’t you?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, but the plan was not quite like that. At
that time, the time you are talking about, there was only mention
of the fact that we were obliged to bring the Nazi Party into the
Government.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But eventually, when the Nazi
Party came in, on 30 January 1933, the plan was that it would be
well harnessed to conservative elements. That was the idea in President
Von Hindenburg’s mind, was it not?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And you were one of the conservative
and stable elements, if I understand you rightly; isn’t
that so?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes. It has been explained here that it was
the special wish of President Von Hindenburg that I should remain
in the Government.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: In order to keep Hitler’s Government
peace-loving and respectable. Is that a fair way of putting it?
<span class='pageno' title='20' id='Page_20'></span></p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, so as to prevent Hitler’s revolutionary
movement in general from exercising their methods too much within
the Government, too.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And, Defendant, you have told
us that up to this time you had been a diplomatist. When you
became a Minister, did you not think that you had some responsibility
for keeping the Government respectable and peace-loving
as a Minister of the Reich?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: To be sure, but the question was only how far
it was in my power to accomplish this.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I don’t want to go into the
workings of your mind too much, I just want to get this clear. You
realized that as a Foreign Minister, and as a well-known figure to all
the Chancelleries of Europe, that your presence in the Government
would be taken throughout Europe, as a sign of your approval and
your responsibility for what the Government did, did you not?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: I doubt that very much. Perhaps one might
have hoped so.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just let’s consider it.
Is it your case that up to November of 1937 you were perfectly
satisfied with the peace-loving intentions and respectability of the
Government?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: I was convinced of the peaceful intentions of
the Government. I have already stated that. Whether I was satisfied
with the methods...</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What about respectability? By
“respectability” I mean the general standard of decency that is
required by any government, under which its people are going to be
reasonably happy and contented. Were you satisfied with that?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: I was by no means in agreement with the
methods, above all in connection with the domestic policy.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I would just like to look
at that for a moment. Did you know about the “Brown Terror” in
March of 1933, some 6 weeks after the Government was formed?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: I only knew of the boycott against the Jews,
nothing else.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you remember the affidavit
that has been put in evidence here, made by the American Consul,
Mr. Geist, Document 1759-PS, Exhibit USA-420?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: May I see it?</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, just let me remind you.
It is a long affidavit, and there are only one or two parts I want
to put to you.
<span class='pageno' title='21' id='Page_21'></span></p>

<p>Mr. Geist gives detailed particulars of the bad treatment, the
beating, and assaulting, and insulting, and so on, of Jews as early
as March 1933. Did you know about that?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: I know of these occurrences; I do not know
this affidavit, I have not seen it, but I do know about the occurrences
from complaints made by foreign diplomatic representatives.
And according to them—and as concerns my attitude to these
events—I repeatedly applied to Hitler and urgently implored him
to have them stopped. But I do not know anything more about the
details.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Just leaving that affidavit for
the moment, as Foreign Minister, you would receive—you did
receive, did you not, a synopsis or account of what was appearing
in the foreign press?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, that I did but whether I received all of
those things I do not know.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Just let me take an example.
You had been Ambassador at the Court of St. James from 1930 to
1932, if my recollection is right; had you not?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And you realized—whether you
agreed with what was in them or not—the London <span class='it'>Times</span> and the
<span class='it'>Manchester Guardian</span> were newspapers that had a great deal of
influence in England, didn’t you?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, yes.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you know that in April
1933 both these newspapers were full of the most terrible stories of
the ill-treatment of Jews, Social Democrats, and Communists in
Germany?</p>

<p>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is quite possible. I cannot remember
it any more now; but those were certainly the very cases which I
brought up before Hitler, drawing his attention to the effect that
this was having abroad.</p>

<p>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I just want to consider
the extent which these papers were alleging. As early as the 12th
of April 1933 the <span class='it'>Manchester Guardian</span> was saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The inquirer, by digging only an inch below the surface,
which to the casual observer may seem tranquil enough, will,
in city after city, village after village, discover such an abundance
of barbarism committed by the Brown Shirts that
modern analogies fail...”—describing them as an instrument—“...of
a Terror that although wanton is systematic—wanton
in the sense that unlike a revolutionary Terror it is
<span class='pageno' title='22' id='Page_22'></span>
imposed by no outward necessity, and systematic in the sense
that it is an organic part of the Hitlerite regime.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you know that this and quotations like these were appearing
in responsible British papers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is D-911, which is the collection of extracts and,
with Mr. Wurm’s affidavit, will be Exhibit GB-512.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Did you know that was the line that
was being taken, that it was systematic in the sense of being an
organic part of the Hitler regime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, in that sense certainly not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you know that the British
paper, the <span class='it'>Manchester Guardian</span>, was quoting, “...an eminent
German conservative, who is in close touch with the Nationalist
members of the German Government, and certainly more sympathetic
to the Right than to the Left...” has given the number of
victims as 20,000—as many as 20,000 in April? Did you know that
the figure was being put that high?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, and I do not believe it, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, let us see what the German
press was saying.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 24th of April 1933 the <span class='it'>Times</span> was quoting the <span class='it'>Hamburger
Fremdenblatt</span>, which, in turn, was invoking official sources and
stating that there were 18,000 Communists in prison in the Reich
and that the 10,000 prisoners in Prussia included many social intellectuals
and others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would the <span class='it'>Hamburger Fremdenblatt</span>, which had a very long
career as a newspaper, if it misquoted official sources under your
Government in April 1933, have misrepresented the position? It
would not, would it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That I do not know, but I do know that a lot
of trouble is always being stirred up by means of figures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But Defendant, here is a figure
quoted, as far as I know, by a responsible Hamburg paper, as an
official figure, requoted by the London <span class='it'>Times</span>, which is the principal
paper in England. Wasn’t that sufficiently serious for you to bring
it up in the Cabinet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I am very sorry, but with all respect to the
papers—and even the London papers—they do not always tell the
truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No. That is a perfectly reasonable
comment. Newspapers, like everyone else, are misinformed.
But when you had a widespread account of terrible conditions
giving large numbers, did you not, as one of the respectable elements
<span class='pageno' title='23' id='Page_23'></span>
in this Government, think that it was worthy of bringing it up in
Cabinet and finding out whether it was true or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: How do you know that I did not do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is what I am asking. Did
you bring it up, and what was the result when you did?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already told you before that I always
remonstrated about these incidents, with Hitler—not in the Cabinet,
but with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is not what I asked you.
You see, Defendant, what I asked you was why you did not bring
it up in the Cabinet. Here was a Cabinet established with conservative
elements to keep it respectable. Why did you not bring it
up in the Cabinet and try and get the support of Herr Von Papen,
Herr Hugenberg, and all the other conservative gentlemen in the
Cabinet of whom we have heard? Why did you not bring it up?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: For the very simple reason that it seemed to
be more effective to tell Hitler directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: In April 1933, some 2 months
after it was formed, are you telling the Tribunal that you did not
think it was worth while to bring a matter up in the Reich Cabinet?
Within 2 months of Hitler coming into power, it had become so
“Führer-principled” that you could not bring it up in the Cabinet?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I repeat—and after all I alone should be the
one to judge—that I considered direct representations made to
Hitler more effective.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Well, now, I just
want—I do not suppose you were interested, but did you know
about the putting into concentration camps of any of the gentlemen
that I mentioned to the Defendant Von Papen: Herr Von Ossietzski
or Herr Mühsam or Dr. Hermann Dunker, or any of the other left-wing
writers and lawyers and politicians? Did you know that they
had gone to a concentration camp from which they never returned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You did not know at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: At any rate, you knew—as
your documents have shown—when you went to London in June,
you knew very well how, at any rate, foreign opinion had crystallized
against Germany because of the treatment of the Jews and
the opposition parties, did you not, when you went to the world
economic conference in June?
<span class='pageno' title='24' id='Page_24'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. That was mentioned by me in a report
that was read in Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now you say that your reaction
was to go to Hitler and protest. I just want to look at what the
existing documents show that you did. Now, let us take April, first
of all. Would you look at Document D-794?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Document Book 12a, Page 8. It will be Exhibit
GB-513.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, this is a letter from you to Hitler dated the 2d of April 1933:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Italian Ambassador telephoned me last night and informed
me that Mussolini had declared himself prepared to
deny, through the Italian delegations abroad, all news about
the persecution of the Jews in Germany that had been
distorted by propaganda, if we should consider this course
useful. I thanked Herr Cerruti, also on your behalf, and told
him that we would be glad to accept his offer.</p>

<p>“I regard this friendly gesture of Mussolini’s as important
enough to bring it to your notice.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What did you think had been distorted by propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, please read this part. Here it says, “the
news had been distorted by propaganda.” That is what it is about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is what I was so interested
in, Defendant. What did you think had been distorted, and how
much knowledge had you, so that you could decide whether the
news had been distorted or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That I really cannot tell you any more today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You knew that Jews had been
beaten, killed, taken away from their families, and put into concentration
camps and that their property had been destroyed and was
beginning to be sold under value. You knew that all these things
were happening, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, certainly not at that time. That they
were beaten, yes, that I had heard; but at the time no Jews were
murdered or perhaps only once in one individual case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, so you see that the <span class='it'>Times</span>
and <span class='it'>Manchester Guardian</span> of that date gave the most circumstantial
examples of typical murders of Jews? You must have seen that;
you must have seen that the foreign press was saying it. Why did
you think that it was distorted? What inquiry did you make to discover
whether it was distorted?
<span class='pageno' title='25' id='Page_25'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Who—who—who—who gave me information
about—about—about—murders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am putting it to you that it
was in the foreign press. I have given you the two examples from
the press of my own country; and obviously from what Signor
Mussolini was saying, it was in the press of other countries. You
must have known what they were saying. What inquiries did you
make to find out whether it was true or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I used the only way possible for me, namely
through the police authorities concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you ask Himmler, or did
you ask the Defendant Göring?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Most certainly not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What? You asked Himmler? Or
did you ask the Defendant Göring? Why not? Why not? He was the
head, inventing the Gestapo and the concentration camps at that
time. He would have been a very good man to ask, would he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The man who could have given me information
was the chief, the supreme head of the Police, and it was in
no way personally...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you ask the Defendant
Frick?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In any case, I did not ask him personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Certainly not personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: May I suggest to you that I do
not want to take up time? Why did you not take the trouble to ask
Göring or Frick or anyone who could have given you, as I suggest,
proper information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you look at Document 3893-PS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The document was handed to the defendant.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will find it at Page 128 of Document Book 12a.
My Lord, that will become Exhibit GB-514.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, quoting you on the 17th of
September 1933, on the Jewish question:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Minister had no doubt that the stupid talk abroad about
purely internal German affairs, as for example the Jewish
problem, will quickly be silenced if one realizes that the
necessary cleaning up of public life must temporarily entail
individual cases of personal hardship but that nevertheless it
served only to establish all the more firmly the authority of
justice and law in Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='26' id='Page_26'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Was that your view in September 1933, of the action against the
Jews and against the left-wing sympathizers up to that time, that it
was a “necessary cleaning up of public life,” which would, of course,
temporarily involve “individual cases” of hardship, and that was
necessary “more firmly” to establish “the authority of justice and
law in Germany”? Was that your view?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I told you during—during—during my—I
think it was the day before yesterday in answer to the question of
what my attitude was toward the Jewish problem, that in view of
the inundation and domination of public life in Germany by Jews
which occurred after the last war, I thought it absolutely right to
have these things either eliminated or restricted. That is what I
am referring to here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So that it is right—I mean, you
are not running away from what you said on the 17th of September
1933—that you thought the treatment of the Jews in 1933 a “necessary
cleaning up of public life” in Germany? Are we to take it that
your view then is your view now, and you do not deviate from it
at all? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That is still my view today, do you not see,
only it should have been carried out by different methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: All right. Well, we will not go
into discussions of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Am I to take it that you knew and approved of the breakdown
of political opposition?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, that is...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, then, let us take it by
stages. Did you believe in the prescribing, the making illegal of the
Communist Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In those days, most certainly, because you
have heard, have you not, that we were facing civil war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Very well. You agreed with
that. Did you agree with the breaking down and making illegal
of the trade unions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What did you do to protest
against the breaking down of the trade unions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That was in a sphere—this sphere did not
concern me at all. I was Foreign Minister and not Minister of the
Interior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Well, again, I am not
going to argue with you. You thought it was perfectly right as
<span class='pageno' title='27' id='Page_27'></span>
Foreign Minister to remain and give your support and authority to
a government which was doing something of which you disapproved,
like breaking down the trade union movement. Is that how we are
to take it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. Did you ever hear that a minister...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now what about...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I would like to say, did you ever hear that
every cabinet minister must leave the cabinet if he does not agree
with one particular thing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Every cabinet minister for
whom I have any respect left a cabinet if it did something of which
he morally disapproved, and I understood from you that you
morally disapproved of the breaking down of the trade union
movement. If I am wrong, correct it. If you did not disapprove,
say so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not think that it was immoral. It was a
political measure, but not an immoral one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Then let us take Number 3,
take the Social Democratic Party, that was a party which had taken
a great share in the Government of Germany and of Prussia for the
years since the war. Did you think it right, morally right, to make
that party illegal and unable to take any further share in the
carrying on of the country?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, certainly not. But I do not at all know...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Let us get it clear. Did you
think it right or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I just told you “No” but I do not at all know
whether you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What did you do to protest
against that? What did you do to protest against the dissolution of
the Social Democratic Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The most I could do against this dissolution
was to state my objections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: To whom did you state your
objection against the dissolution of the Social Democratic Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To Hitler, again and again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Again and again you didn’t
raise the dissolution of the parties, the opposition parties? You
never raised that in the Cabinet; that is right, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I cannot remember whether this question was
discussed in the Cabinet; I do not know any more.
<span class='pageno' title='28' id='Page_28'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. All right. Let us just
pass to another aspect and still on 1933. I just want you to have
in mind what was happening in 1933. Did you know that after you
had announced that Germany was leaving the Disarmament Conference
and the League of Nations, that orders for military preparations
to deal with the possibility of war, as consequent on that
action had been got out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. In 1932-1933 I knew nothing about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: In 1933, yes, it started—in
Document C-140, Exhibit USA-51—on the 25th of October 1933.
Now, Defendant, you were Foreign Minister. Are you telling the
Tribunal that neither had Hitler nor Marshal Von Blomberg—I think
he was Reichswehrminister—that none of them told you, as a result
of this action, “we shall have to have the preparations ready in case
sanctions, including military sanctions, are imposed on Germany.”
Did none of them tell you that that was to be the result of your
move in foreign policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, nor was there any action to be feared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Well, now it is rather—you
will agree with me—it is rather odd not to inform the Foreign
Minister of the possible consequences of his policy in the military
preparations you are taking to deal with it; it is rather odd, isn’t it
in any system of government, of totalitarian, democratic, or anything
you like, it is rather odd not to tell the Foreign Minister what
you are doing in the way of military preparations, to deal with his
policy, isn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I certainly had to decide on the opinion as to
whether any danger threatened from our withdrawal from the
League of Nations and the Disarmament Conference, that is, I
had to decide whether this might have any probable consequences.
The military had their own opinion, and presumably—but I do not
know, anyhow, I was not informed; but there were certain discussions
amongst the General Staff, I assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now, I just want to sum
up for 1933 and I want to do that quickly. May I take it, that up
to the end of 1933, despite these matters which I have put to you,
that you were perfectly satisfied with the respectability and peace-loving
intentions of the Government; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now, just let us turn to
1934. You remember your conversation with Mr. Dodd, the American
Ambassador, which you mentioned in your Document Book Number
1, at Page 54. It was on the 28th of May 1934; and Mr. Dodd
<span class='pageno' title='29' id='Page_29'></span>
had told you, apparently, what he had said to Hitler about the way
Americans are trying to control profiteering by great financial interests.
He said he was glad that—then he says that you said that
you were glad that he had informed Hitler and then Mr. Dodd added
“that the Chancellor had not agreed with me.” Then he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Von Neurath was silent for a moment after my remarks. It
was plain that he was entirely of my way of thinking. He
begged me to say to Washington that the outbreak was
entirely contrary to the German Government purpose, but he
did not commit himself on Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What did you mean by that, “...that the outbreak against Jews
was entirely contrary to German Government purpose...”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: By that I wanted to say that the members of
the Cabinet, the majority of them, were against these methods.
Apart from that, I can add that I had just asked Mr. Dodd to go
and see Hitler personally so as to give backing to the suggestions
I was making to Hitler. I took him there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But did you know, in May 1934,
that the German Government was going in for systematic and
virulent anti-Semitism, didn’t you know that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Anti-Semitic propaganda, I knew mainly
from Herr Goebbels’ speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes; well, let us pass to something
a little more concrete. Had you any reason for disliking
General Von Schleicher or General Von Bredow?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What was the effect on your
mind of these two gentlemen and Frau Von Schleicher being killed
in the blood purge of the 30th of June 1934?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I hardly need to answer that. Of course, I
was repulsed by it, that is clear; but then I told you the other day
that unfortunately in the case of such a revolt, innocent people
always have to suffer as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. But just let us get it
clear. You told the Tribunal the other day that you thought—and
had some reason for thinking—that there was a movement in the
SA, that is, a movement led by Röhm and Ernst, and I suppose
people that you would consider undesirable, of that sort. What
reason had you to suppose that General Von Schleicher and General
Von Bredow had been in a conspiracy, if any?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I had no reason at all, and I do not believe
today that they were plotting.
<span class='pageno' title='30' id='Page_30'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you hear about the unfortunate
way in which Herr Von Papen kept on losing secretaries at
the same time? You remember, you know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Exactly the same.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you know that Herr Von
Bose and Jung were killed, Von Tschirschky was arrested, and two
other gentlemen were also arrested? Did you hear about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I did, through Herr Von Papen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And did you regard the blood
purge of the 30th of June as just another element in the necessary
cleaning up of public life?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To the extent that it was carried out with all
the outrages and murders of innocent people, most certainly not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Why did you go on in a government
that was using murder as an instrument of political action?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already told you twice that in the case
of such revolutions such mishaps cannot be avoided, most unfortunately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Well, now, let us take
just another of your 1934 experiences. You knew about the terroristic
acts that were going on in Austria in May and June of 1934,
did you not? And by “terroristic acts”—don’t let us have any doubt
about it—what I mean is causing explosions in Austrian public
utilities and railways and things like that. I mean dynamite. I
don’t mean anything vague. You knew that such acts were going
on in Austria in May and June 1934, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I heard about it, and I always opposed
that sort of thing because I knew that it was done by Nazis; and
let me say once more, mostly by Austrian Nazis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What position did Herr Köpke
have in your Ministry on the 31st of May 1934?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: He was the Ministerial Director.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Ministerial Director: Quite a
responsible position, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you remember Herr Köpke
reporting to you on the 31st of May 1934, on a visit of Baron von
Wächter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I cannot remember that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, just think; you know.
Baron von Wächter was one of the leaders of the Putsch against
<span class='pageno' title='31' id='Page_31'></span>
Dollfuss 6 weeks later on the 25th of July. Don’t you remember
Herr Köpke making a report to you and you passing it on to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I cannot remember that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Let’s refresh your memory if
you don’t remember it. Would you look at Document D-868? It
will become Exhibit GB-515. Just look at it. I will read it over, but
just look at the signatories carefully; and if you will be good
enough to look at the top, I think you will find on the original, there
are your own initials; and on the left hand side there is a note:
“The Reich Chancellor has been informed 6/6.” That is on the 6th of
June. That is initialed “L” by Lammers—Dr. Lammers. Then there
is a note below that: “From the Reich Chancellor on 6th June,” also
initialed by Lammers I think. And on the other side you will see
there is a note which is certainly initialed “Lammers.” “Habicht is
coming today... L 6/6.” And this memorandum comes back from
the Reich Chancellor to the Foreign Office on the same day. Now
just let’s see what report you were getting from Austria and passing
on to Hitler. We will omit, unless you want it particularly, a
description of Baron von Wächter’s fresh, youthful appearance in
Paragraph 1; but it goes on to say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“His statements were obviously made in full consciousness
of serious responsibility. His estimation of the affairs and
personalities that came under review was clear and definite.
Herr Von Wächter drew up for me, too, a picture of the
situation in Austria which was, in some of its colors, even
darker and more serious than it had appeared to us here up
till now. The extremist tendencies of the National Socialists
in Austria were constantly on the increase. Terrorist acts
were multiplying. Regardless of who actually undertook the
demolitions and other terrorist acts in individual cases, each
such act provoked a new wave of extremism and also of
desperate acts. As Herr Von Wächter repeatedly and sadly
stressed, uniformity of leadership was lacking. The SA did
what it wanted and what it, for its part, considered necessary.
The political leadership at the same time introduced
measures which sometimes meant the exact opposite. Thus
the great terrorist action, as the result of which the railway
lines leading to Vienna were blown up, was by no means
committed by Marxists but by the Austrian SA and indeed
against the wishes of the political leadership which, as he
believed, did not participate in any way either in the act or
its preparation. Such is the picture as a whole. In detail, in individual
provinces and districts, the confusion was, if possible,
even greater.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='32' id='Page_32'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he says that the main seat of unrest is Carinthia, and
where conditions were worst. And then he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Herr Von Wächter thought that here improvements must be
introduced most speedily, that is, by means of the centralization
of all forces active in the interests of National Socialism
both in and outside Austria. Personal questions should play
no part here. The decisive word in this connection could, of
course, be given only by the Führer himself. He, Wächter,
was in complete agreement with Herr Habicht on all these
matters. As far as he knew, Herr Habicht had already succeeded
in having a brief conversation with the Reich Chancellor
today.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now just let’s pause there for a moment. Herr Habicht was appointed
about that time press attaché at the German Embassy in
Vienna. The appointment of Herr Habicht as press attaché would
be done either by you or with your approval, would it not? It was
under your department?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Right now I no longer know if Herr Habicht—Herr
Habicht was the National Socialist leader (Landesleiter) for
Austria in Munich and whether or not he went to Vienna as press
attaché I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, you can take it that he
went to Vienna as press attaché at this time, at the end of May
1934; and what I am asking you is, was it not either at your order
or with your approval that he was given a post which gave him
diplomatic immunity in the middle of his plottings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: If Herr Habicht was really there, this
happened neither with my knowledge nor with my approval; but
presumably it was arranged by the Ministry of Propaganda to
whom these press men were subordinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, you will agree with me,
Defendant, that this is not a very pleasant document; it does not
describe a very pleasant state of affairs. Let me remind you, this
came, from your Ministerial Director to you and went on to the
Führer and came back from Dr. Lammers with a note: “Habicht is
coming today.” Surely as...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To the Führer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Besides, Mr. Prosecutor, I want to point out
to you that here only the Austrian National Socialists are being
discussed. With them I had nothing at all to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What I am pointing out to you
is that the document, this Foreign Office document goes to the
<span class='pageno' title='33' id='Page_33'></span>
Reich Chancellery; it comes back on the 6th of June with a note
from Dr. Lammers saying, “Habicht is coming today.” You must
have known all about Habicht on the 6th of June. It is mentioned
in this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not at all. I have this note from Lammers
which means that Habicht was coming to see the Reich Chancellor.
And this report from my Ministerial Director I immediately passed
on to the Reich Chancellor to show him what the conditions were
in Austria. That was the reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But you remember Herr Von
Papen giving evidence a few days ago; and when I asked him who
were the leading Reich German personalities who influenced the
Putsch in Austria in July 1934, he thought for a long time and the
only leading Reich German personality that he could remember as
influencing the Putsch was this very Herr Habicht?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well then, what I am putting
to you is—and pausing there to get it—that you knew very well,
on the 6th of June 1934, that Herr Habicht, this leading Reich
personality according to the Defendant Von Papen, was organizing
revolution in Austria, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Whatever makes you suppose a thing like
that? Herr Habicht never came to see me. He went to see the Reich
Chancellor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You saw this report. This is a
report of your Ministerial Director. I have just read what Von
Wächter thought.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: There is not one word about Herr Habicht in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, I just read that to you.
May I remind you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The decisive word in this connection could of course be
given only by the Führer himself. He, Wächter, was in complete
agreement with Herr Habicht on all these matters.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In other words, what Wächter is putting to the Foreign Office were
the views of Habicht no less than himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is certainly in there. Well, all these
terrorist acts and all these disturbances which are described in this
document were brought to the attention of the Reich Chancellor
by myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just look what the
report says at the foot of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“But when nothing happened in the meantime, and on the
other hand the counter measures of the Austrian Government
<span class='pageno' title='34' id='Page_34'></span>
grew more brutal and severe from day to day, the radical
elements made themselves felt once more and came forward
with the statement that the Chancellor had issued his order
only for tactical reasons and was inwardly in agreement with
every manly act of opposition and had in view, as his own
political aim, merely the weakening of Dollfuss’ hateful
system, though in a way which should be as unobtrusive as
possible to the outside world. They are now working with
this argument.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Listen to the next bit, his suggestion to you, the nearest warning
of trouble which any Foreign Minister ever heard of:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“One constantly stumbles on this idea during discussions and
it is secretly spreading. A change must be made soon and a
uniform leadership created. Otherwise, as Herr Von Wächter
concluded his impressive description, a disaster may occur
any day which would have the worst possible consequences
in foreign policy, not only for Austria alone, but above all
for Germany herself.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then, dramatically, in the middle of the conversation, Herr
Von Wächter receives a telephone message that he had better not
go back to Vienna or he will be arrested on his arrival; and within
6 weeks he had started the Putsch and Chancellor Dollfuss had
been shot. Do you remember now? Did you not appreciate, at the
beginning of June 1934, that there was the greatest danger of an
uprising and trouble in Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, quite definitely so. That is the very
reason why I sent the report to the Chancellor. I could not interfere
in Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Perhaps you can tell me, on
the question on which the Defendant Von Papen was unable to
specify, who, in your opinion, were the other prominent Reich
German personalities who were behind the Dollfuss Putsch in
Austria? You say you were not. Who, in your opinion, were these
personalities that Herr Von Papen mentions as being behind the
Dollfuss Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I know absolutely none. I know only Habicht,
and him I knew only as a person against whom I protested to
Hitler because of his inflammatory actions. Apart from him I did
not know any Reich Germans. The others were all Austrian
National Socialists who have been mentioned innumerable times
during the Trial but whom I did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am not mentioning them. I
am mentioning the Defendant Von Papen’s prominent Reich German
personalities, and I am trying very hard to find out who they were
<span class='pageno' title='35' id='Page_35'></span>
Are you taking the same line, that the only one you can remember
is the press attaché, Herr Habicht? Is that all you can help the
Tribunal in this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already said—and that will have to
suffice—I do not know anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Is it your opinion that your
Minister, Dr. Rieth, knew nothing about this, despite what Mr. Messersmith
says on that point? Do you think Dr. Rieth knew nothing
about the Putsch?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I cannot tell you to what extent Herr Rieth
was informed. You know, however, that when he acted ostentatiously
later on that I recalled him right away. Apart from that,
I always forbade the ministers to meddle in such matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You haven’t any doubt in your
own mind that Dr. Rieth knew all about the impending Putsch,
have you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Oh yes, I have considerable doubts that he
knew all about it. I do not believe so because his whole character
was not at all like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, at any rate, you knew
on the 25th of July that the Austrian Nazis had made this Putsch
and had murdered Dollfuss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That is not exactly a secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, I know it. A lot of these
things were not secrets. What I am interested in was your knowledge—when
you found out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Afterward, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But didn’t that give you any
qualms about remaining in a government which had extended its
policy of murder from at home to abroad, through the Party
elements in Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: If I were responsible for every single murderer,
for every single German murderer who was active abroad, then I
would have had a lot of work to do, would I not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You knew, Herr Von Neurath—and
I shall remind you how in a moment—you knew that the
Austrian NSDAP was in close touch with, and acting under, the
orders of Hitler all the time when Hitler was head of your Government;
you knew that perfectly well, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: He was the chief of the NSDAP. It is quite
natural that they were collaborating with him.
<span class='pageno' title='36' id='Page_36'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes. Now there is just one other
point...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. I want to tell you another thing: I continuously
remonstrated with Hitler, together with Herr Von Papen,
about the fact that this Herr Habicht was doing the things he was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: We will take that up in a
moment. I just want to get one point of fact. Does this accord with
your recollection: I have been through all the reports of the Defendant
Von Papen; and apart from three personal reports, two dealing
with Herr Von Tschirschky and one dealing with abuse of Hitler,
which is of no political significance, we have 28 reports. Nineteen
of these reports are marked as being copies to the Foreign Office.
Is that in accord with your recollection, that three but of four of
Herr Von Papen’s reports would come to you to be seen by you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That I cannot tell you at this late day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You are quite right, Herr
Von Neurath. You wouldn’t know how many went to you, but you
say you saw a considerable number of Herr Von Papen’s reports.
I think there were 19; I am sure you can take it that they are
marked—19 are marked, “Passed the Foreign Office”.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do believe you, yes; but the question is how
many were submitted to me, for I did not receive every individual
report from every ambassador or minister abroad. Otherwise, I
would have been drowned in paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I quite agree; but what I asked
you was, did you receive these from Herr Von Papen, who was
supposed to be in a rather special position dealing with a very
difficult problem? Did you receive a considerable number of reports
from Herr Von Papen to Hitler as passed to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can tell you only that I received some reports
but certainly not all. I cannot tell you more than that today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, perhaps this would be
a convenient time to break off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn at this time.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I just want to get two or three
facts clear about 1935 before I put some questions to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the 10th of March Germany announced the establishment of
an air force and on the 16th of March I think you, among others,
signed the law introducing compulsory military service. You explained
all that to us; I don’t want to go over it again, but I just
want to ask you about the Secret Reich Defense Law of the 21st of
May 1935. Would you look at General Thomas’ comment on it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is at Page 52 of Document Book 12. It is about
Page 71 of the German document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Number 12a or b?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Number 12, My Lord. That is
the original one; Page 52, My Lord.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Central Directorate of the supreme Reich authorities,
ordered in case of war, has influenced the development and
the activity of the war economy organization to such an extent
that it is necessary to discuss this matter in detail. The
foundations had already been laid, for the central organization
of the supreme Reich authorities in the event of a war prior
to 1933 in many discussions and decrees, but it was radically
altered when the National Socialists came into power, and
especially by the death of Reich President Von Hindenburg.
The latest orders were decreed in the Reich Defense Law of
21 May 1935, supposed to be published only in case of war
but already declared valid for carrying out war preparations.
As this law fixed the duties of the Armed Forces and the
other Reich authorities in case of war, it was also the fundamental
ruling for the development and activity of the war
economy organization.” (Document 2353-PS)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And you will remember that on the same day the Defendant
Schacht had been made Plenipotentiary for War Economy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you appreciate at the time, Defendant, that that law was the
fundamental ruling for the development and activity of the war
economy organization?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, but only in case of a war, that is, in case
of mobilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You see that the point that I am
putting to you is that it had already been declared valid for carrying
out war preparations. Didn’t you understand that it was a big
step forward for war preparations?
<span class='pageno' title='38' id='Page_38'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not at all. It was not a big step forward at
all. It was only the establishing of the necessary measures in case
of a war. In every country you have to guarantee the co-operation
of the various offices in the event of an attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is your view. Now, at this
time, up to May 1935, is it correct that the German Foreign Office
was still staffed by diplomats or Foreign Office officials of the older
school and had not yet been invaded by the products of the Bureau
Ribbentrop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you receive any warnings
from your own staff as to the happenings in Austria, or the rearmament,
the declaration of the air force, and the conscription?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I was advised about happenings in Austria, as
can be seen from the report which you submitted to me. The re-establishment
of the Armed Forces was a decision which was made
in the Cabinet, and of course I knew about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, but—I am sorry, probably
I did not put the proper emphasis on the word. When I said warning
I meant a real warning from your officials that these happenings
were making Germany regarded abroad as being bloodthirsty and
warmongering. Did you get any warnings from your officials?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Certainly not, for that was not the case, and
if any assertions like that were being made abroad, they certainly
were not true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, would you look at Document
3308-PS, the affidavit of the interpreter Paul Schmidt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Page 68 of Document Book 12a, and it is Page 65
or 66 of the German version, Paragraph 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, just let me read you Paragraphs
4 and 5, as to what Herr Paul Schmidt says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“4. The attempted Putsch in Austria and the murder of Dollfuss
on 25 July 1934 seriously disturbed the career personnel
of the Foreign Office because these events discredited Germany
in the eyes of the world. It was common knowledge
that the Putsch had been engineered by the Party, and the
fact that the attempted Putsch followed so closely on the heels
of the blood purge within Germany could not help but suggest
the similarity of Nazi methods, both in foreign and in domestic
policy. This concern over the repercussions of the attempted
Putsch was soon heightened by a recognition of the fact that
these episodes were of influence in leading to the Franco-Soviet
Consultative Pact of 5 December 1934, a defensive
<span class='pageno' title='39' id='Page_39'></span>
arrangement which was not heeded as a warning by the
Nazis.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant, let’s take that. In these three points, is it correct, as
Herr Schmidt says, that the attempted Putsch and the murder of
Dollfuss seriously disturbed the career personnel in the Foreign
Office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not only the career personnel of my office
were disquieted over this but I, of course, was also disquieted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And taking the last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This concern”—that is the disturbance by the Putsch—“over
the repercussions of the attempted Putsch was soon heightened
by a recognition of the fact that these episodes”—blood purge
and the Putsch—“were of influence in leading to the Franco-Soviet
Consultative Pact of December 5, 1934, a defensive
arrangement which was not heeded as a warning...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct, that among your staff the concern was heightened
by recognizing that the blood purge and the Putsch had alarmed
France and the Soviet Union as to the position of Germany and led
to the consultative pact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, that is a personal opinion of the interpreter
Schmidt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, with respect to you, Defendant,
it is not. What interpreter Schmidt is saying is that that was
the opinion of your experienced staff in the Foreign Office and that
is what I am putting to you. Is he not right in saying that your
experienced staff were concerned that these events had had their
effect on the consultative pact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not in the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, at any rate...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can only repeat, the two things had no connection
with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Is he correct in his last statement
that that arrangement was not heeded as a warning by the
Nazis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That I cannot say; I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now, just look at the next
paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The announcement in March of the establishment of a German
Air Force and of the introduction of conscription was
followed on 2 May 1935 by the conclusion of a mutual assistance
pact between France and the Soviet Union. The career
personnel of the Foreign Office regarded this as a further
<span class='pageno' title='40' id='Page_40'></span>
very serious warning as to the potential consequences of German
foreign policy, but the Nazi leaders only stiffened their
attitude toward the Western Powers, declaring that they were
not going to be intimidated. At this time the career officials
at least expressed their reservations to the Foreign Minister,
Neurath. I do not know whether or not Neurath in turn
related these expressions of concern to Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, just let us take that. Did—do you agree that the career
personnel of the Foreign Office regarded the Franco-Soviet pact as
a further very severe, very serious warning as to the potential consequences
of German foreign policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not know in the name of which personnel
Herr Schmidt is making these statements. But I, at any event, heard
nothing to the effect that my career personnel had expressed these
opinions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, here is Herr Schmidt
saying, “The career officials, at least, expressed their reservations
to the Foreign Minister, Neurath.” That is you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Are you saying that Herr
Schmidt, who after all was a career official although he was an
interpreter for a great deal of the time—are you saying that Herr
Schmidt is not stating what is accurate when he says that your
permanent officials expressed their concern to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: But quite decidedly. How could Herr Schmidt,
who was only an insignificant civil servant at that time, know what
my career personnel told me and in addition, how could Schmidt
judge this? And I should also like to add that Schmidt said here,
before this Court, that this affidavit, or whatever it may be, was
submitted to him after a serious illness and that he personally knew
absolutely nothing more about the contents. That now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You may rest assured, the Tribunal
will correct me if I am wrong, that I put these paragraphs to
Herr Schmidt and he agreed with them when he was giving
evidence before this Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But now just look at one other statement at the end of Paragraph
6. Well, we’ll just—we will read Paragraph 6, because I want
to ask you about the end:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The re-entry of the German military forces into the Rhineland
was preceded by Nazi diplomatic preparation in February.
A German communiqué of 21 February 1936 reaffirmed that
the Franco-Soviet Pact of mutual assistance was incompatible
with the Locarno Treaties and the League Covenant. On the
<span class='pageno' title='41' id='Page_41'></span>
same day Hitler argued in an interview that no real grounds
existed for conflict between Germany and France. Considered
against the background statements in <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>, offensive
to France, the circumstances were such as to suggest that the
stage was being set for justifying some future act. I do not
know how far in advance the march into the Rhineland was
decided upon. I personally knew about it and discussed it
approximately 2 or 3 weeks before it occurred. Considerable
fear had been expressed, particularly in military
circles, concerning the risk of this undertaking. Similar fears
were felt by many in the Foreign Office. It was common
knowledge in the Foreign Office, however, that Neurath was
the only person in Government circles consulted by Hitler who
felt confident that the Rhineland could be remilitarized without
armed opposition from Britain and France. Neurath’s
position throughout this period was one which would induce
Hitler to have more faith in Neurath than in the general run
of ‘old school’ diplomats, whom he (Hitler) tended to hold in
disrespect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well, now, if this minor official, of whom you just talked, knew
about and discussed the march into the Rhineland some 2 or 3
weeks before it occurred, how much before it occurred had you
discussed it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Herr Schmidt must have been clairvoyant, for
2 or 3 weeks in advance even I did not know anything about it.
I heard of it about 1 week before Hitler’s decision, and if I—if it
says here that I—that it was generally known in the Foreign
Ministry that I was the only one in the Government circles consulted
by Hitler who was confident that the Rhineland could be
remilitarized without armed opposition from Britain and France,
it certainly turned out that I was right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You were right—but is it true
that you were the only person in Government circles who thought
that it could be occupied without interference by Britain and
France? Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I am not in a position to say whether I was
the only one, but at any rate, I was convinced of this on the basis
of my knowledge of international conditions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And so that at any rate,
whatever the limitations of Paul Schmidt, he knew what your
position was quite accurately. Was he not right about it in the last
sentence, that your position throughout the period was one which
would make Hitler look to you rather than to the rest, the other
figures of pro-Nazi diplomacy and foreign affairs, because you were
the person who was encouraging him? Is that not the position?
<span class='pageno' title='42' id='Page_42'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not encourage him in any way, but I
described the situation to him as I saw it, and it was later proved
that I had been right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, I just want you to
deal with one other point, which is really 1936, but we will deal
with it as I have been dealing with Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have said once or twice that you objected very strongly to
the description of the Austrian treaty, the treaty between the Reich
and Austria of the 11th of July as being a subterfuge or a façade.
That is right; is it not? You objected very strongly to that view?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Do you know that Hitler had
given instructions to the Gauleiter of the Austrian NSDAP to carry
on the struggle at the same time as the treaty was signed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I do not know anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Just let me remind you. I do
not want to put anything that seems unfair.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Document Book 12, Page 97.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] This is the report of Dr. Rainer,
whom the Tribunal has had the advantage of seeing, and if you
will look at the end of one paragraph he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The agreement of 11 July 1936 was strongly influenced by
the activities of these two persons.”—That is Defendant Seyss-Inquart
and Colonel Glaise-Horstenau—“Papen mentioned
Glaise-Horstenau to the Führer as being a trusted person.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now the next paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At that time the Führer wished to see the leaders of the
Party...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am sorry, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you say 97 of Document Book 12?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I did, My Lord, yes. Yes, My
Lord; it is the third paragraph and begins, “At that time...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh yes, I see it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At that time the Führer wished to see the leaders of the
Party in Austria, in order to tell them his opinion on what
Austrian National Socialists should do.” (Document Number
812-PS)</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='43' id='Page_43'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid it was another “at that time”
that we were looking at. Could you give us some other indication?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, it is in the middle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is on 98 in ours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am so sorry, My Lord. The
paging must be different. I beg Your Lordship’s pardon.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>[<span class='it'>Continuing.</span>] “At that time the Führer wished to see the
leaders of the Party in Austria in order to tell them his
opinion on what Austria National Socialists should do. Meanwhile
Hinterleitner was arrested, and Dr. Rainer became
his successor...”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Mind you, this is the man who is making this statement.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...successor and leader of the Austrian Party. On 16 July
1936 Dr. Rainer and Globocznik visited the Führer at the
Obersalzberg, where they received a clear explanation of the
situation and the wishes of the Führer. On 17 July 1936 all
illegal Gauleiter met in Anif near Salzburg, where they
received a complete report from Rainer on the statement of
the Führer and his political instructions for carrying out the
fight. At the same conference the Gauleiter received organizational
instructions from Globocznik and Hiedler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you not know—did Hitler not tell his Foreign Minister, who
had just supervised the conclusion of this treaty, that he intended
to give the illegal Gauleiter instructions as to how to carry on the
fight? Didn’t he tell you that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, he did not tell me that, but I do
remember—I believe it was the same Dr. Rainer who appeared
here as a witness—who stated that Hitler summoned him and other
Gauleiter and told them that in the future they were to observe
strictly the agreements of 1936. By the way, the matter that you
just quoted is not mentioned at all in the document which was
submitted to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, that’s not mentioned. What
is mentioned is the political instructions for carrying out the fight
and the organizational instructions from Globocznik. At any rate,
you knew nothing about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, it is rather difficult for
you to judge whether the treaty is made sincerely if you do not
know the instructions that are given to the illegal Party in Austria
by Hitler, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, naturally.
<span class='pageno' title='44' id='Page_44'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just let’s deal with
one or two other points. I would just like you to look at what
Mr. Messersmith says at the end of 1935. You remember this statement—I
will give you the reference in a moment—that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...Europe will not get away from the myth that Neurath,
Papen, and Mackensen are not dangerous people and that they
are ‘diplomats of the old school.’ They are in fact servile
instruments of the regime and just because the outside world
looks upon them as harmless, they are able to work more
effectively. They are able to sow discord just because they
propagate the myth that they are not in sympathy with the
regime.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, can you tell us up to the date on which Mr. Messersmith
wrote that—on October 10, 1935—of a single instruction of Hitler’s
that you had not carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not quite understand. A single instruction...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I am sorry; I mislaid
the reference. It is Document Book 12, Page 107. That is the
reference to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You see, Mr. Messersmith is there
saying that you and the Defendant Von Papen and Von Mackensen
are servile instruments of the regime. Now, I am just asking you
whether you could tell us up to the date that Mr. Messersmith wrote,
on 10 October 1935, any instruction of Hitler’s that you had refused
to carry out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not only one, but quite a few. I have testified
as to the number of times I contradicted Hitler, and I have expressed
myself about what Mr. Messersmith is assuming here again—about
the importance of Mr. Messersmith’s affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Defendant, I put it this way:
Up to October 10, 1935, what did you tell the Tribunal was the most
serious thing that Hitler had ordered you to do and you had refused
to carry out? What was the most serious—the one that mattered
most?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well on the spur of the moment, that is a
question that I cannot answer. How should I know what the most
serious question was which I opposed? I opposed all sorts of things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If you can’t remember what
you think is the most serious, I shan’t trouble you with it any
more, but I want...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well, you are quite welcome to submit it to
me, but don’t produce an allegation out of a clear sky without giving
me the chance to refute it.
<span class='pageno' title='45' id='Page_45'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I was asking you to tell us, but
I will pass on to what another American diplomat put. I would like
to ask you about Mr. Bullitt’s report, with which I gather you agree.
My Lord, that is L-150, and it is at Page 72 of the Document
Book 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I hope that there is no difference of the paging—72 of
mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes; it is 74.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, it is 74. I am sorry, My
Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, it is the second paragraph there.
After saying that he had a talk with you, he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Von Neurath said that it was the policy of the German
Government to do nothing active in foreign affairs until ‘the
Rhineland had been digested.’ He explained that he meant
that until the German fortifications had been constructed on
the French and Belgian frontiers, the German Government
would do everything possible to prevent rather than encourage
an outbreak by the Nazis in Austria and would pursue
a quiet line with regard to Czechoslovakia. ‘As soon as our
fortifications are constructed and the countries of Central
Europe realize that France cannot enter German territory at
will, all those countries will begin to feel very differently
about their foreign policies and a new constellation will
develop...’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You agree you said that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, yes, certainly. Yesterday or the day
before I testified in detail about what that was supposed to mean.
Moreover, it does not make any difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I would like to see if you agree
with the meaning I suggest. That is that as soon as you had got your
fortifications in sufficiently good order on your western frontier,
you would proceed to try and secure an Anschluss with Austria and
to get back the Sudetenland from Czechoslovakia. Isn’t that what
it means?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, no, not at all. That is quite clear in the
document. What I meant by this and what I expressed was that these
countries, particularly Czechoslovakia and France, would change
their policy toward Germany, because they could no longer march
through Germany so easily.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You appreciate, Defendant, what
I am putting to you? I think I made it quite clear—that at the time
that you were facing the Western Powers with the remilitarization
<span class='pageno' title='46' id='Page_46'></span>
of Germany and the Rhineland—that is in 1935 and 1936—you were
then giving assurances to Austria, which Hitler did in May 1935, and
you made this treaty in 1936. As soon as you had digested your
first steps, you then turned against Austria and Czechoslovakia in
1938. I am suggesting, you see, that you were talking the exact
truth and prophesying with a Cassandra-like accuracy. That is
what I am suggesting—that you knew very well that these intentions
were there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: What?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You say you didn’t?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not at all, not at all, not at all! That is an
assumption on your part, for which there is absolutely no proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: We will not argue it further
because we will come on to just one other point before we proceed to
1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have told the Tribunal, not once but many times, that you
did not support the Nazi attitude toward the Christian churches, of
oppressing the churches. That is I have understood you correctly,
have I not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, and you say that you
resisted and actively intervened against the repression of the
Church. Would you just look at Document 3758-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that will become Exhibit GB-516. My Lord, Your
Lordship will find it in Document Book 12a, Page 81.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] This is an entry which must have
been fairly early in 1936 in the diary of the Reich Minister of
Justice:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reich Foreign Minister transmits, with a personal note
for confidential information, a letter from Cardinal State
Secretary Pacelli”—that is the present Pope—“to the German
Ambassador in the Vatican, in which he urges an act of pardon
for Vicar General Seelmeyer. He, the Reich Foreign Minister,
remarks to this that after the heavy attacks on German
justice by the Holy See in the note of 29 January, there is no
reason in his opinion to show any deference to the Vatican.
He recommends it, however, since for foreign policy reasons
it is to our interest not to let our good personal relations with
Pacelli cool off.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Defendant, will you tell me anything that showed the
slightest personal interest in the fate of Father Seelmeyer, or were
you only concerned with showing a firm front to the Vatican and not
losing your good relations with Cardinal Pacelli?
<span class='pageno' title='47' id='Page_47'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, the document has
just been submitted to me; I have had no opportunity whatsoever
to look this document over and inform myself about it. Likewise,
I do not know of there having been any talk about a diary of the
Reich Minister of Justice up to now in this Trial. Therefore, I am
not in a position to judge how the Reich Minister of Justice could
have made this entry in his diary at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since these notes have apparently been taken out of their context,
it is not possible for me to form any kind of a picture of the
significance of the entry as a whole, and naturally it is even less
possible for the defendant to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I must protest against the admissibility of this
question and against the submission of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: This is a perfectly good captured
document. It is a copy of the original diary of the Reich Minister
of Justice, and it is therefore admissible against the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, you can see the
original document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, actually, I am just
told by my American colleagues that this diary has been used before,
that extracts were put in in the case against the Defendant
Von Schirach.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Mr. President, I have no objection...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I could not understand a word,
Mr. President. I am sorry, I could not understand. I can hear now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When you make an objection, you should see
that the instrument is in order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What I said was that you can see the original document. And I
am told now that the original document has been used before, and
that therefore there is nothing to prevent its being used in cross-examination.
It is a captured document, and you can see the
original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I did not know that, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: What I am putting to you,
Defendant, is that your statement to the Minister of Justice shows
no concern for the individual priest about whom the complaint had
been made; it is merely concerned with your relations with the
Vatican and with Cardinal Pacelli, as he then was. Is that typical
of your interferences? Is this typical of your interferences for the
sake of ill-treated priests?
<span class='pageno' title='48' id='Page_48'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I naturally cannot remember this case any
more, but the way it stands there in the entry I was perfectly justified.
According to the entry, I said that we had no reason to show
any special consideration after the then Cardinal State Secretary,
or Pope had attacked German justice, but that, as Foreign Minister
I considered it important not to disturb our relations with Pacelli.
I cannot see what conclusions you want to draw from this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I don’t want to trespass
on the ground of my Soviet colleagues, but you know that the
Czech report accuses you, with complete impartiality as far as sect
is concerned, of your Government ill-treating the Catholics, Protestants,
Czech National Church, and even the Greek Church in Czechoslovakia.
You know that all these churches suffered during your
protectorate—do you agree that all these churches suffered under
your protectorate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: All right, I won’t go into the
details, but I am suggesting to you that your care about the various
religious confessions did not go very deep.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That is again an assertion on your part which
you cannot prove.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I would just like to put
one thing. You remember telling the Tribunal this morning of the
excellent terms that you were on with the archbishop of Prague?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I said that I had good relations with the
archbishop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I would just like you to look at
this copy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, this is a copy, but General Ecer assures me that he can
get the original from the Czech Government files. I received it only
a half hour ago. General Ecer, who is here from Czechoslovakia,
says that he can vouch for the original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I’d like the defendant to look at it. Is that a letter which you
received from the archbishop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Document D-920, and it will be Exhibit GB-517:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Your Excellency, very esteemed Herr Protector of the Reich:</p>

<p>“Your last letter has filled me with such sorrow because I
could not but gather from it that not even Your Excellency
is prepared to believe me—that I lost consciousness and had
to call university Professor Dr. Jirasek, who remained beside
my sickbed for an hour—he is coming again today, together
with the specialist on internal diseases....”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And then he gives his name.
<span class='pageno' title='49' id='Page_49'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Your Excellency may be sure that I shall always do what I
can to please you. But please, have mercy on me, too, and
do not demand that I should act against the laws of the
Church.</p>

<p>“Yours, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, Karl Cardinal Kaspar, M. P. prince archbishop.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I cannot say what this refers to. I have no
idea; there is nothing in it, and I cannot tell you what it referred to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You can’t remember this occasion
when the prince archbishop wrote to you and told you the
effect, the illness that he had suffered from and beseeched you not to
ask him to do something against the laws of the Church? It doesn’t
remain in your mind at all, does it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: All right, we’ll leave that. Well
now, I want you to just tell me this, before we pass on to the later
occurrences in 1937. You remember you dealt yesterday with your
speech—I think it was to the German Academy of Law. You remember
the speech, in August of 1937? I can give you a reference.
Would you like to look at it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I only need the reference to where I spoke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You remember it, I only wanted
to save time. Don’t you remember? I will put it to you if you like.
It is the speech of the 29th of August 1937, and I will give you the
reference in one moment. What I wanted to ask you was this—you
said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The unity of the racial and national will created through
Nazism with unprecedented élan has made possible a foreign
policy by means of which the chains of the Versailles Treaty
were broken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What did you mean by “the unity of the racial will” produced
by Nazism?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: By that I probably meant that all Germans
were unified more than ever before. At this date I can no longer
tell you what I meant by this, either. But nevertheless I was merely
establishing a fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. Now tell me. That was
in August 1937. You told the Tribunal the effect that the words of
Hitler, on the 5th of November 1937, had upon you, and your
counsel has put in the statement by Baroness von Ritter. After
these words...
<span class='pageno' title='50' id='Page_50'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In November?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, November of 1937.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, after these words had had
that effect, with whom did you discuss them among the people who
had been present at the Hossbach interview?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: This speech was not made at Berchtesgaden at
all. That is a mistake; it was at Berlin, this address.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I didn’t say Berchtesgaden; I
said at the Hossbach conference. We call it the Hossbach conference
because he took the minutes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already told you yesterday with whom
I spoke, General Von Fritsch, and with Beck, who was then Chief
of the General Staff; and I also testified that we agreed at that
time jointly to oppose Hitler and the tendency which he had revealed
in this speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you speak about it to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. I testified yesterday in detail that I did
not have a chance to speak with Hitler until 14 or 15 January, because
he had left Berlin and I could not see him. That was the
very reason why I asked for my resignation at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you speak about it to Göring
or Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now I want you to just tell me
one word or two about this Secret Cabinet Council to which you
were appointed after you left the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would you look at the first sentences of the report of that meeting
on the 5th of November?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Page 81 in the English Document Book 12, and
Page 93 of the German document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is only the first two sentences, Defendant:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Führer stated initially that the subject matter of today’s
conference was of such importance that its detailed discussion
would certainly, in other states, take place before the Cabinet
in full session. However, he, the Führer, had decided not to
discuss this matter in the larger circle of the Reich Cabinet
because of its importance.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, if you will look at the people who were there: There is the
Führer; the Minister for War; the three Commanders-in-Chief; and
the Minister of Foreign Affairs.
<span class='pageno' title='51' id='Page_51'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Defendant, supposing that in February or March 1938,
Hitler had wanted to discuss Austria before the same Council, the
same limited number of people. Just let us see who would have
taken the places of the people who were there. Instead of Von
Blomberg and Von Fritsch, you would have had the Defendant
Keitel as Chief of the OKW, and Von Brauchitsch as Commander-in-Chief,
would you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I believe so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: As a matter of fact, Raeder and
Göring maintained their positions; the Defendant Von Ribbentrop
had taken yours; and you were president of the Secret Cabinet
Council. Lammers was secretary of the Cabinet, and Goebbels had
become more important as Minister of Propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well now, I would just like you to look and see who the people
were that formed the Secret Cabinet Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Lordship will find that on Page 8 of Document Book 12;
and it is Page 7 of the German document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Now, do you see who they are? There
are the Defendant Von Ribbentrop, the Defendant Göring, the
Führer’s Deputy, Hess, Dr. Goebbels, and the Chief of the Reich
Chancellery, Lammers, Von Brauchitsch, Raeder, and Keitel. You
are saying, if I understand you, that this Secret Cabinet Council
had no real existence at all. Is that your case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Why were you receiving special
funds for getting diplomatic information as president of the Secret
Cabinet Council?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not receive any. I should like to know...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh, didn’t you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, let us just have a look at
this. Would you look at Document 3945-PS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is 129 in Document Book 12a. It will be Exhibit
GB-518.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you will look at the letter of the 28th of August 1939 from
Lammers to you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In conformity with your request, I have had the sum of
10,000 Reichsmark, which had been placed at your disposal
for special expenses in connection with the obtaining of diplomatic
information, handed to Amtsrat Köppen.</p>

<p>“I enclose the draft of a certificate showing how the money
was used, with the request to send me the certificate after
execution, at the latest by the end of the financial year.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='52' id='Page_52'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And if you will turn over to the next page, 131, you will see
that at the end of March, which was toward the end of the financial
year, you signed a certificate saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I have received 10,000 Reichsmark from the Reich Chancellery
for special outlays entailed in obtaining diplomatic information.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, will you tell us why you were getting special expenses for
obtaining diplomatic information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I can tell you that. That is an expression
used at the request of Lammers who had the treasury of the Reich
Chancellery under him, so that I could meet the expenses of my
office; that is, for one typist and for one secretary. And in order
to justify this to—I do not know which authority, what this authority
is called, to the Finance Ministry—I had no special budget—Herr
Lammers asked me to use this expression. That can be seen
from a certificate which is also in there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is all right. I am going to
refer to the other letters. But why was it necessary that the
expenses of your one secretary and one typist should not be audited?
As it shows on pages...</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the pages are 134 and 135.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I just said that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: On Page 134 you will see there
is a letter from you to Lammers: “In my bureau there is a need to
incur special expenses, to audit which it does not appear to me
advisable.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why wasn’t it advisable to audit the expenses of your typist and
secretary?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can no longer tell you that just now. But
at any rate, I did not use any more money for diplomatic information;
but these are merely office expenses which I figured in there.
And so at the end of this letter which you have submitted to me
there is...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Please, let me finish my statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: There is a report here to me, from my—from
this secretary, in which he says—no, this is not the letter I thought
it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now, if you are finished,
I anticipated you might say it was office expenses. Would you look
at Document 3958-PS?
<span class='pageno' title='53' id='Page_53'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that will be Exhibit GB-519.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I submit, that shows you your office
expenses were carried on the ordinary budget, the letter of 8 April
1942 to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that in the book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, yes; I am so sorry. It
is 140. I beg Your Lordship’s pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] That is a letter to you which says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reich Minister for Finance has agreed that the budgetary
needs announced by you for the financial year 1942 be
shown in Special Plan 1. I therefore have no objections to
having the necessary expenditure granted—even before the
establishment of Special Plan I—within the limits of these
amounts, namely:</p>

<p>“For personal administrative expenditures, up to 28,500
Reichsmark; for official administrative expenditures, up to
25,500 Reichsmark; total 54,000 Reichsmark.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That was providing for your office and personal expenditures
during the same period for which you were getting these additional
sums. So I am suggesting to you that if these sums of 10,000 marks
which you got every now and then were not for office expenditures,
I would like you to tell the Tribunal what they really were for.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I would be very pleased if I were also
told about this, for I no longer know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, they are your letters, and
you got the money. Can’t you tell the Tribunal what you got it for?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I cannot right now. Perhaps I can tell you
afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Possibly it was for obtaining
diplomatic information, it says—</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Dr. Von Lüdinghausen makes the point that the letter
I put was in 1939. Of course, there were other letters. I have not
troubled the Tribunal with each one, but there is another letter in
which there is a reference to a payment on the 9th of May 1941,
and, of course, another reference to a payment on the 30th of June
1943. My Lord, these are Pages 133 and 134. I am sorry; I did not
give the details. Perhaps I ought to have indicated that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The letter on Page 137, which may have some
bearing, is a letter from the man signed “K”—from the man who
made the previous applications?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='54' id='Page_54'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps would you like to look at that, Defendant? It is Document
3945-PS, a letter of the 14th of July 1943, signed “K”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When I went into the matter of the special funds, the competent
people in the Reich Chancellery showed an entirely
understanding attitude in this matter and asked for a written
application from Your Excellency. When I replied that I did
not wish to produce such an application before success was
guaranteed, they asked for a little more time for a further
exchange of views. After a few days I was told that I could
produce the application without hesitation, upon which I
handed over the letter which I had previously withheld. The
amount requested has been handed to me today and I have
duly entered this sum in my special cashbook as a credit.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, but in spite of this...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now does that help you?
Can you tell the Tribunal what were the outlays, the special outlays
for the obtaining of diplomatic information for which you received
this money?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I am very sorry; I absolutely cannot—I can
no longer recall this matter at all. And the remarkable part is that
this letter is dated the 14th of July 1943, when I no longer had any
functions whatsoever, when I had left altogether. At this moment,
I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is very strange, you know.
In a further letter, in Document 3958-PS, on 8 January 1943, and in
succeeding letters on the 4th of March and the 20th of April, the
end of your occupation of the premises of 23 Rheinbabenallee is
explained there and when your expenses ceased when you went to
live in the country. I was just going to ask you about that—a little
about that house. If you will just look at the affidavit of Mr. Geist,
the American consul...</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is Document 1759-PS, Exhibit USA-420.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I referred to this this morning, and
the passage that I want you to tell us about is in the middle of a
paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is at the foot of Page 11 of the affidavit in the
English version.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you have the separate document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, it is at the foot
of Page 11. The paragraph begins:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Another instance of the same nature occurred with regard to
my landlord...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='55' id='Page_55'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, if Your Lordship goes
on another 10 lines, after explaining about his landlord having to
give up his house to the SS, he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I know that on many occasions where it was thought necessary
to increase the pressure, the prospective purchaser or his
agent would appear accompanied by a uniformed SA or SS
man. I know because I lived in the immediate neighborhood
and knew the individuals concerned, that Baron von Neurath,
one time Foreign Minister of Germany, got his house from
a Jew in this manner. Indeed, he was my next-door neighbor
in Dahlem. Von Neurath’s house was worth approximately
250,000 dollars.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Was that 23 Rheinbabenallee?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, yes...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Who acquired it for you, so
that the president of the nonexistent Secret Cabinet Council could
have it as an official residence? Who acquired it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not understand that. Who did what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Who acquired 23 Rheinbabenallee?
Who got it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can tell you about that. In the year 1937,
when Hitler was erecting the large buildings for his Reich Chancellery,
he told me one day that I would have to move from my apartment,
which was situated behind the Foreign Office, because he
wanted the garden for his Reich Chancellery, and the house would
be torn down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said that he had given instructions to the Reich Building
Administration to find other living quarters for me. The Reich
Building Administration offered me various expropriated Jewish
residences. But I refused them. But now I had to look for a house
myself, and my personal physician, to whom I happened to mention
this matter, told me that he knew of a place in Dahlem, that was
Number 23 Rheinbabenallee, where he was house physician to the
owner. This owner was Lieutenant Colonel Glotz, who was the
brother of a close friend of mine. I informed the Reich Building
Administration about this and told them that they should get in
touch with this gentleman. In the course of the negotiations, which
were conducted by the Reich Building Administration, a contract
of sale was drawn up for the price quoted by Mr. Geist, and the
price was in marks, not in dollars. This sum, at the request of
Lieutenant Colonel Glotz, was paid to him in cash, and on his wish
I persuaded the Finance Minister to have this money transferred to
Switzerland.
<span class='pageno' title='56' id='Page_56'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I might remark that I was still Foreign Minister at the time.
Afterward, I remained in this house for the simple reason that I
did not find another one, and Herr Von Ribbentrop, my successor,
moved into the old Presidential Palace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in the year 1943 this house was destroyed. At the moment,
therefore, I still cannot explain what these moneys were for and
whether they were official payments made by the Reich Treasury.
With the best intentions, I cannot tell you. But the statements
made by Mr. Geist here are completely wrong as I have just stated.
I did not buy or have this house transferred from a Jew, but from
the Christian Lieutenant Colonel Glotz.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You tell us that you passed the
money on to Switzerland on his account?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I? Yes. Because Herr—Herr Glotz went to
Switzerland. I believe, indeed, his wife was non-Aryan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I see. I would just like to put
the next sentence and then I will leave this document:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I know too that Alfred Rosenberg, who lived in the same
street with me, purloined a house from a Jew in similar
fashion.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know anything of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not know how Herr Rosenberg acquired
his house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Now, Defendant, I want you to
come now to March of 1938. Perhaps I can take this shortly if I
have understood you correctly. You know that the Prosecution
complained about your reply to the British Ambassador with regard
to the Anschluss. As I understand you, you are not now suggesting
that your reply was accurate; but you are saying that that was the
best of your information at the time, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is quite correct. It is true. That was
an incorrect statement but I just did not know any better; do
you see?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You say that you did not hear—that
neither Hitler nor Göring told you a word about these ultimatums
which were given first of all to Herr Von Schuschnigg and
secondly to President Miklas; you were told nothing about that? Is
that what you are telling?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, at that time—at that time I knew nothing.
I heard about them later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I am going to leave
that. I am not going into that incident in detail—we have been
<span class='pageno' title='57' id='Page_57'></span>
over it several times—in view of the way that the defendant is not
contesting the accuracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I should like to know when he heard of the
true facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am much obliged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] When did you hear of the true facts
of the Anschluss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I heard the details for the very first time here,
when this report of Legation Counsellor Hewel was submitted to
me. Prior to this time I probably heard that there had been pressure
exerted on Herr Schuschnigg, but nothing else. I actually
learned the exact details for the first time here in Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I only want to get it quite clear.
You say that between the 11th of March and your coming to Nuremberg,
you never heard anything about the threat of marching into
Austria, which had been made by the Defendant Göring, or Keppler,
or General Muff on his behalf? You never heard anything about
that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I heard nothing of that sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, then I do want to ask you
about the assurance that you gave to M. Mastny, the Czechoslovak
Minister in Berlin. I would like you to look at Document TC-27
which you will find in Document Book 12, Page 123 of Document
Book 12. The passage that I want to ask you about is in the sixth
paragraph. After dealing with the conversation with the Defendant
Göring about the Czechoslovak mobilization, it goes on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“M. Mastny was in a position to give him definite and binding
assurances on this subject”—that is, the Czechoslovak mobilization—“and
today”—that is, the 12th of March—“spoke with
Baron von Neurath, who, among other things, assured him
on behalf of Herr Hitler that Germany still considers herself
bound by the German-Czechoslovak Arbitration Convention
concluded at Locarno in October 1925.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, you have told the Tribunal—we have had the evidence of
Baroness von Ritter—that the meeting on the 5th of November had
this very disturbing effect on you and in fact produced a bad heart
attack. One of the matters that was discussed at that meeting was
attack, not only on Austria but also on Czechoslovakia, to protect
the German flank. Why did you think, on the 12th of March, that
Hitler would ever consider himself bound by the German-Czechoslovak
Arbitration Treaty which meant that he had to refer any
dispute with Czechoslovakia to the Council of the League of Nations
or the International Court of Justice? Why on earth did you think
<span class='pageno' title='58' id='Page_58'></span>
that that was even possible, that Hitler would submit a dispute with
Czechoslovakia to either of these bodies?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can tell you that quite exactly. I already
testified yesterday that Hitler had me summoned to him on the
11th for reasons that I cannot explain up to this day and told me
that the march into Austria was to take place during the night.
In reply to my question, or rather to my remark that that would
cause great uneasiness in Czechoslovakia, he said that he had no
intentions of any kind at this time against Czechoslovakia and that
he was—he even hoped that relations with Czechoslovakia would
be considerably improved by the invasion or occupation of Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this sentence and from his promise that nothing would
happen, I concluded that matters would remain as they were and
that, of course, we were still bound to this treaty of 1925. Therefore,
I was able to assure M. Mastny of this with an absolutely clear
conscience.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did you believe a word that
Hitler said on the 12th of March? Did you still believe a word that
Hitler said on the 12th of March 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, still at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I thought Von Fritsch was a
friend of yours; wasn’t he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Who?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Colonel General Von Fritsch; he
was a friend of yours?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You did not believe that he had
been guilty of homosexuality did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, never.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, didn’t they—didn’t you
know that he had been subject in January 1938 to a framed-up
charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you please answer instead of shaking
your head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I knew that, of course; and I learned of
it and the fact that this charge was a fabrication of the Gestapo but
not of Hitler, at least in my opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, didn’t you know that
those—these unsavory matters concerning Field Marshal Von
Blomberg and Colonel General Von Fritsch had been faked up by
members of the Nazi gang, who were your colleagues in the Government?
<span class='pageno' title='59' id='Page_59'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. The details were unknown to me, of
course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: You see, you remember that at
the time of Munich, when you came back to the field—came back
into activity for some time, President Beneš did appeal to this German-Czechoslovak
Arbitration Convention and Hitler brushed the
appeal to one side. Do you remember that? In September 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No; that, I do not know, for at that time I
was not in office any longer and I did not get to see these matters
at all. I do not know about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, you don’t know; of course,
it was in the German press and every other press that he appealed
to this treaty and Hitler refused to look at it; but you say that you
honestly believed on the 12th of March that Hitler would stand by
that Arbitration Treaty; that’s what you said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I had no misgivings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, that might be a convenient
moment to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Defendant, you spoke yesterday
with regard to the memorandum of Lieutenant General Friderici.
Do you remember in that memorandum he referred to a memorandum
of yours on how to deal with Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, now, I would like you just to look at Document 3859-PS,
so that the Tribunal can see your attitude toward the Czechs from
your own words.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is at Page 107 of Document Book 12a.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I will read first your letter to
Lammers of the 31st of August 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that will be Exhibit GB-520.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Dear Herr Lammers: Enclosed I send you the memorandum
which I mentioned in advance in my letter of 13 July 1940 ...
about the question of the future organization of the Bohemian-Moravian
country. I enclose another memorandum on the
same question, which my Secretary of State K. H. Frank has
drawn up independently of me and which, in its train of
thoughts, leads to the same result”—I ask you to note, the
next words—“and with which I fully agree. Please present
both memoranda to the Führer and arrange a date for a personal
interview for myself and State Secretary Frank. As I
<span class='pageno' title='60' id='Page_60'></span>
have heard from a private source that individual Party and
other offices intend to submit proposals to the Führer for
separating various parts of the Protectorate under my authority,
without my knowing these projects in detail, I should be
grateful to you if you would arrange the date for my interview
early enough for me, as the competent Reich Protector
and one who understands the Czech problem, to have an
opportunity, together with my State Secretary, to place our
opinions before the Führer before all sorts of plans are suggested
to him by other people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I would just like to take what I hope will be the gist of
your own memorandum. If you will turn it over—this is your
memorandum—take the first paragraph, Section I:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Any considerations about the future organization of Bohemia
and Moravia must be based on the goal which is to be laid
down for that territory from a state-political (staatspolitisch)
and ethnic-political (volkspolitisch) point of view.</p>

<p>“From a state-political standpoint there can be but one aim:
total incorporation into the Greater German Reich; from an
ethnic-political standpoint to fill this territory with Germans.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then you say that you point the path; and if you go on to
Section II, in the middle of Paragraph 2, you will find a subparagraph
beginning—</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is the top of Page 109, Your Lordship’s copy:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“These 7.2 million Czechs, of whom 3.4 millions live in towns
and communities of under 2,000 and in the country, are led
and influenced by an intelligentsia which is unduly puffed up
in proportion to the size of the country. This part of the
population also tried, after the alteration of the constitutional
situation of this area, more or less openly to sabotage or at
any rate postpone necessary measures which were intended
to fit the circumstances of the country to the new state
of affairs. The remainder of the population, that is small
craftsmen, peasants, and workmen, adapted themselves better
to the new conditions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then, if you go on to Paragraph 3, you say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“But it would be a fatal mistake to conclude from this that
the Government and population behaved in this correct manner
because they had inwardly accepted the loss of their
independent state, and incorporation into Greater Germany.
The Germans continue to be looked upon as unwelcome
intruders and there is a widespread longing for a return to
the old state of affairs, even if the people do not express it
openly.
<span class='pageno' title='61' id='Page_61'></span></p>

<p>“By and large, the population submit to the new conditions
but they do so only because they either have the necessary
rational insight or else because they fear the consequences of
disobedience. They certainly do not do so from conviction.
This will be the state of affairs for some time to come.</p>

<p>“But”—go on to Section III—“as things are like that, a decision
will have to be taken as to what is to be done with the Czech
people in order to attain the objective of incorporating the
country and filling it with Germans as quickly as possible
and as thoroughly as possible.</p>

<p>“The most radical and theoretically complete solution to the
problem would be to evacuate all Czechs completely from this
country and replace them by Germans.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>Then you say that that is not possible because there are not sufficient
Germans to fill it immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, if you go on to Paragraph 2, to the second half, you say—My
Lord, that is the last six lines of Page 110:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It will, where the Czechs are concerned, rather be a case on
the one hand of keeping those Czechs who are suitable for
Germanization by individual selective breeding, while on the
other hand of expelling those who are not useful from a racial
standpoint or are enemies of the Reich, that is, the intelligentsia
which has developed in the last 20 years. If we use such
a procedure, Germanization can be carried out successfully.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Defendant, you know that in the Indictment in this Trial
we are charging you and your fellow defendants, among many other
things, with genocide, which we say is the extermination of racial
and national groups, or, as it has been put in the well-known book
of Professor Lemkin, “a co-ordinated plan of different actions aiming
at the destruction of essential foundations of the life of national
groups with the aim of annihilating the groups themselves.” What
you wanted to do was to get rid of the teachers and writers and
singers of Czechoslovakia, whom you call the intelligentsia, the
people who would hand down the history and traditions of the Czech
people to other generations. These were the people that you wanted
to destroy by what you say in that memorandum, were they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not quite. Here there are...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But just before you answer,
what did you mean by saying, in the last passage that I read to
you, “...expelling those who are not useful from a racial standpoint
or are enemies of the Reich, that is, the intelligentsia which has
developed in the last 20 years”? Did you mean what you said? Were
you speaking the truth when you said it was necessary to expel the
intelligentsia?
<span class='pageno' title='62' id='Page_62'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To that I can answer only “yes” and “no.”
First of all, I should like to say that from this report it becomes
apparent that the memorandum was written by Frank. I joined
my name to it, and this was on 31 August 1940. The memorandum
which I—the memorandum which is referred to in the Friderici
report is from a—is dated later I think, although I do not know
offhand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think you will find—I will
give you, in a moment, the letter from Ziemke, who transmits
Hitler’s view, and I think you will find that it is this memorandum
that Hitler is dealing with. I will show you Frank’s memorandum
in a moment. I am suggesting to you now, as you say to Lammers,
that you enclosed your memorandum and you enclosed another
memorandum, of which I will read you the essential part in a
moment, which is the memorandum of Karl Hermann Frank. But
this is a...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: They are both by Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I’ll show it—no; but look at
your own letter of the 31st of August: “Enclosed I send you the
memorandum,” and you go on: “I enclose another memorandum... which
my State Secretary K. H. Frank has drawn up independently
of me... with which I fully agree.” I am suggesting to you, you
know that this is your—this is your memorandum referred to as
the—in the Friderici document...</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is Page 132 of Document Book 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] ...where General Friderici says,
“After ample deliberation the Reich Protector expressed his view
about the various plans in a memorandum.” I am suggesting to you
that this is your memorandum which you sent on to Lammers for
submission to the Führer. Are you saying—are you really going to
tell the Tribunal that this is not your memorandum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I do not want to say that at all. At the
moment I really do not know any longer. I did not write it, but I
agreed with its contents; the letter to Lammers says so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, if you agreed with
its contents, what did you mean by saying that you would have to
expel the intelligentsia, except that you were going to break down
the Czechs as a national entity and expel the people who would
keep going that history and tradition and language? Isn’t that why
you wanted to expel the intelligentsia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I never mentioned the word “destroy,” but
said that the intelligentsia...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I said “expel”...
<span class='pageno' title='63' id='Page_63'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I see.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: ...which is your own word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The class of the intelligentsia was the greatest
obstacle to co-operation between Germans and Czechs. For that
reason, if we wanted to achieve this co-operation, and that was still
the aim of our policy, then this intelligentsia had to be reduced in
some way and principally their influence had to be diminished, and
that was the meaning of my explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, you said to achieve your
policy, but by achieving your policy you meant to destroy the Czech
people as a national entity with their own language, history, and
traditions, and assimilate them into the Greater German Reich. That
was your policy, wasn’t it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: My policy was, first of all, to assimilate Czechoslovakia,
as far as possible. But in the final analysis that could
not have been achieved for generations. The first thing to do was
to bring about co-operation so as to have peace and order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, now before I put to you
the memorandum of Frank with which you entirely agree, would
you look at Paragraph VII of your own memorandum?</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Page 113 of Document Book 12a.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] In Section VII you say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If one considers the gigantic tasks facing the German nation
after a victorious war, the necessity for a careful and rational
utilization of Germans will be apparent to everyone. There
are so many tasks that have to be tackled at once and
simultaneously that a careful, well-thought-out utilization of
the Germans who are suitable for carrying out these tasks is
necessary.</p>

<p>“The Greater German Reich will have to make use of the
help of foreigners on a large scale in all spheres and must
confine itself to appointing Germans to the key positions and
to taking over branches of public administration where the
interests of the Reich make it absolutely necessary...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You were, in this memorandum, blueprinting the plans for
dealing with the Czechs after the war on the basis of the German
victory; that is, that they should disappear as a nation and become
assimilated to the German Reich. Wasn’t that what was in your
mind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To make the Czechs disappear as a nation was
altogether impossible. That was not possible at all. But they were
to incorporate themselves more closely into the Reich, and that is
what I mean by the word “assimilate.”
<span class='pageno' title='64' id='Page_64'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, it is also stated in this memorandum—earlier, much
earlier—that from the racial point of view—if you want to use that
unpleasant expression—there was an extraordinarily large number
of Germans within Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just turn over and
see how the—your State Secretary’s memorandum with which you
entirely agree—how that runs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, Your Lordship will find the beginning of that is
enclosure Number 2 on Page 115.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The State Secretary states his
problem. He says, in the second sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The question as to whether the Protectorate, with a Reich
Protector as its head, is suitable for settling the Czech problem
and should therefore be retained or whether it should now
give place to some, other form of government is being raised
by various people and is the cause of this memorandum. It
will briefly: (A) Indicate the nature of the Czech problem;
(B) analyze the present way in which it is being dealt with;
(C) examine the proposed alterations from the point of view
of their suitability, and finally: (D) express an independent
opinion on the whole question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well now, I would like you just to look at your State Secretary’s
independent opinion with which you entirely agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oughtn’t you to read the last two lines?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh yes, My Lord, I’m sorry.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On a correct decision depends the solution of the Czech
problem. We thus bear the responsibility for centuries to
come.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, My Lord, Frank’s own opinion starts on Page 121 in Section
D of the memorandum, and he begins by saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The aim of Reich policy in Bohemia and Moravia must be the
complete Germanization of area and people. In order to attain
this there are two possibilities:</p>

<p>“I. The total evacuation of the Czechs from Bohemia and
Moravia to a territory outside the Reich and settling Germans
in the freed territory; or,</p>

<p>“II. If one leaves the majority of the Czechs in Bohemia and
Moravia the simultaneous application of a great variety of
methods working toward Germanization, in accordance with
an X-year plan.</p>

<p>“Such a Germanization provides for: 1) The changing of the
nationality of racially suitable Czechs; 2) the expulsion of
racially unassimilable Czechs and of the intelligentsia who
<span class='pageno' title='65' id='Page_65'></span>
are enemies of the Reich, or ‘special treatment’ for these and
all destructive elements; 3) the recolonizing of the territory
thus freed with fresh German blood.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I want you just to turn to where your State Secretary
gets down to concrete suggestions as to this policy of Germanization.
Remember that you entirely agree, in your letter to Lammers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Your Lordship will turn to Page 123, there is a heading
“Youth; fundamental change in education; extermination of the
Czech historical myth.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] That is the first point: Destroy any
idea they might have of their history, beginning with the time of
St. Wenceslaus, nearly a thousand years ago. That is your first point.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Education toward the Reich idea; no getting on without
perfect knowledge of the German language; first doing away
with the secondary schools, later also with the elementary
schools; never again any Czech universities, only transitionally
the <span class='it'>Collegium Bohemicum</span> at the German university in
Prague; 2 years compulsory labor service.</p>

<p>“Large-scale land policy, creation of German strongpoints and
German bridges of land, in particular pushing forward of the
German national soil from the north to the suburbs of Prague.</p>

<p>“Campaign against the Czech language, which is to become
merely a dialect as in the 17th and 18th centuries, and which
is to disappear completely as an official language.</p>

<p>“Marriage policy after previous racial examination.</p>

<p>“In attempts at assimilation in the Reich proper, the frontier
Gaue must be excluded.</p>

<p>“Apart from continuous propaganda for Germanism and the
granting of advantages as an inducement, severest police
methods, with exile and ‘special treatment’ for all saboteurs.
Principle: ‘Zuckerbrot und Peitsche.’ ”—What is that “Zuckerbrot
und Peitsche”?</p>

<p>“The employment of all these methods has a chance of success
only if a single central Reich authority with one man at its
head controls its planning, guiding, and carrying out. The
direct subordination of the ‘master in Bohemia’ to the Führer
clarifies the political character of the office and the task, and
prevents the political problem from sinking down to an administrative
problem.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, it was essential to this policy that you should
keep your job as Reich Protector and Frank should keep his as State
Secretary, and the Gauleiter of the Danube should not be able to
interfere and take away Brno as the capital of his Gau.
<span class='pageno' title='66' id='Page_66'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant, do you tell this High Tribunal, as you told Dr. Lammers,
that you entirely agree with what I suggest to you are dreadful,
callous, and unprincipled proposals? Do you agree with these
proposals?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I do not agree in the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, why did you tell Lammers
you did? Why, when things were going well, did you tell Lammers
that you did agree with them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Later I made an oral report to the Führer
about this. Apart from that, the statements which you just made
show quite clearly that this first memorandum was written by
Frank, who then added the second memorandum to it, and if you
say, as you said at the end just now, that it was my purpose to
remain in office as Reich Protector, then I can only tell you that
the purpose, if there was a purpose in this connection, was that
Frank wanted to become Reich Protector. However, from the point
of view of the contents of this memorandum, I can certainly no
longer identify myself with them today, nor did I do so on the
occasion when I reported to the Führer. This becomes clear from
the testimony which I gave yesterday. This testimony...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I’m not concerned with
your testimony yesterday; I am concerned with what you wrote in
1940 when you wrote—and I will read the words again; I have read
them three times:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I enclose another memorandum on the same question which
my State Secretary, K. H. Frank, has drawn up independently
of me”—independently of me—“and which in its train of
thoughts leads to the same result, and with which I fully
agree.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Why did you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have just now told you that I no longer
agree with these statements today, and that at the time when I
verbally reported to the Führer, I did not support these statements
either, but to the contrary, I made the proposals to him which I
explained yesterday and to which I received his agreement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, are these documents correctly
copied? Because you see that in the letter of the 31st of August 1940
there is a reference in the margin, “Enclosure 1; Enclosure 2.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Therefore, the letter identifies the document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, that is so. The
one is, as I am suggesting, the defendant’s; the other is Frank’s.
<span class='pageno' title='67' id='Page_67'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: And you have mentioned, Defendant,
about what—that you dealt with them otherwise to the Führer.
I suggest to you that that is not true, that is not true that you dealt
with them otherwise to the Führer. I am putting it quite bluntly
that it is not true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In that case I must regret to say that you
are lying. For I—I must know. After all, I must know whether I
talked to the Führer. I delivered a verbal report to him in person
and Frank was not present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, just let us look at the
report, at your report. Your Lordship will find it on Page 7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will see whether it is true or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Page what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Page 7, My Lord. It is Document
D-739 of the same book, 12a; it is Exhibit G-521.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, this is a memorandum, a secret memorandum of the
representative of the Foreign Office in the Office of the Reich
Protector, of the 5th of October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You will remember your letter was
the 31st of August. It says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Regarding the reception of the Reich Protector and State
Secretary Frank by the Führer, I have learned the following
from authentic sources:</p>

<p>“To begin with, the Minister of Justice, Gürtner, gave a
report on the Czech resistance movement, during the course
of which he maintained that the first trial of the four chief
ringleaders would shortly take place before the Peoples’
Court.</p>

<p>“The Führer objected to this procedure and declared that
execution squads were good enough for Czech insurgents and
rebels. It was a mistake to create martyrs through legal
sentences, as was proved in the case of Andreas Hofer and
Schlageter. The Czechs would regard any sentence as an injustice.
As this matter had already entered the path of legal
procedure it was to be continued with in this form. The
trials were to be postponed until after the war, and then
amidst the din of the victory celebrations, the proceedings
would pass unnoticed. Only death sentences could be pronounced,
but would be commuted later on to life imprisonment
or deportation.
<span class='pageno' title='68' id='Page_68'></span></p>

<p>“Regarding the question of the future of the Protectorate, the
Führer touched on the following three possibilities:</p>

<p>“1. Continuation of Czech autonomy in which the Germans
would live in the Protectorate as co-citizens with equal rights.
This possibility was, however, out of the question as one had
always to reckon with Czech intrigues.</p>

<p>“2. The deportation of the Czechs and the Germanization of
the Bohemian and Moravian area by German settlers. This
possibility was out of the question too, as it would take
100 years.</p>

<p>“3. The Germanization of the Bohemian and Moravian area
by Germanizing the Czechs, that is, by their assimilation.
The latter would be possible with the greater part of the
Czech people. Those Czechs against whom there were racial
objections or who were anti-German were to be excepted
from this assimilation. This category was to be weeded out.</p>

<p>“The Führer decided in favor of the third possibility; he gave
orders via Reich Minister Lammers, to put a stop to the
multitude of plans regarding partition of the Protectorate.
The Führer further decided that, in the interests of a uniform
policy with regard to the Czechs, a central Reich authority
for the whole of the Bohemian and Moravian area should
remain at Prague.</p>

<p>“The present status of the Protectorate thus continues.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And look at the last sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Führer’s decision followed the lines of the memoranda
submitted by the Protector and State Secretary Frank.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Defendant, although you answered me so sharply a moment
ago, that document says that after the reception of the Reich Protector
and the State Secretary, the representative of the Foreign
Office in your office says that the decision of the Führer followed
the lines of the memoranda put forward by you and your State
Secretary Frank. Why do you say that I am wrong in saying it is
untrue that a different line was followed by the Führer? It is set
out in that document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To that I have the following reply to give:
First of all, the document shows that the Führer touched upon the
following three eventualities with reference to the question of the
future of the Protectorate. They are the three possibilities which I
said yesterday I had proposed. The document also shows, though
not directly, that the cause for this Führer conference was primarily
quite a different one than merely deciding the question of the
Protectorate. On the contrary, the Minister of Justice was present
and a legal question in regard to the treatment of the members of
<span class='pageno' title='69' id='Page_69'></span>
the resistance movement was the cause for the discussion and Frank
came to Berlin for this reason. I had been to Berlin before that
and I talked to the Führer, not about the memorandum, which I had
in my hand, but about my misgivings in general and the future of
our policy in the Protectorate. My report included those proposals
which are mentioned here under 1, 2, and 3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It says there at the end, “The decision followed the lines of the
memoranda submitted by the Protector and State Secretary Frank.”
That remark was added by Herr Ziemke or whoever had written
the document, but what I said yesterday about the policy is correct.
And even if I admit that at that time in the letter to Lammers I
did identify myself with these enclosures it was nevertheless
dropped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I want to remind you that
in the passage which I referred to last in your memorandum, as
opposed to that of Frank, you were putting forward the organization
of the Greater German Reich. I take it in this way, that you
envisaged yourself that in the event of a German victory in the
war the Czech part of Czechoslovakia would remain part of a
Greater German Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I beg your pardon. It had already been
incorporated and here it is also expressly stated that it should
remain in that condition, as a protectorate but as a special structure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, I just—are you saying
that your policy, after this period—this was in the autumn of 1940—that
your policy towards the Czechs was sympathetic?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not think it changed except when there
were strong resistance movements there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, why was it that you
forbade, in the middle of 1941, any reference of the handling—to
the discussion of the handling and treatment of all questions about
the German-Czech problem? Why did you forbid its discussion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To prevent these problems which were the
cause of this memorandum from arising again and again, namely
the problem of individual parts of the Protectorate being torn away
and added to the lower Danube or the Sudeten country with a
general resettlement. That was the purpose of my report to the
Führer, as I explained yesterday, so as to put a stop to that discussion
once and for all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But you also—you particularly
prohibited, did you not, any public statements addressed to the
Czech population? Well, let us look at the document.
<span class='pageno' title='70' id='Page_70'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is Document Number 3862-PS, My Lord. Your Lordship will
find it at Page 126 of Document Book 12a. My Lord, it becomes
Exhibit GB-522.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] It is for distribution through your
various offices and you say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“For the motive stated I order that in the future, when
arrangements and publications of any kind concerning the
German-Czech problem are made, the views of the whole
population are more than ever to be directed to the war and
its requirements while the duty of the Czech nation to carry
out the war tasks imposed on it jointly with the Greater
German Reich is to be stressed.</p>

<p>“Other questions concerning the German-Czech problem are
not suitable subjects for public discussion at the present time.
I wish to point out that, without detriment to my orders,
administrative handling and treatment of all questions about
the German-Czech problem are to be in no way alluded to.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Requisite public statements about the political questions of
the Protectorate and in particular those addressed to the
Czech population are my business and mine alone and will be
published in due time.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Why did you want to prohibit so severely the addressing of any
public statements to the Czech population?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That is addressed not only to the Czech population,
but especially to the Germans, and just for this reason—that
was some special event which I no longer remember—it says
here “for the motive stated I order that”—when there was again
a discussion about the future of the Protectorate or something was
published. That was the reason and I pointed out that that is why
it was forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, I suggest to you
about the—your proposals and Frank’s speak for themselves. I
want you to help me on one other matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember after the closing of the universities that the
question arose, what was to happen to the students? There were
about 18,000 students who were, of course, out of work because
they could not...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I beg your pardon, I beg your pardon. There
were not so many; there were at the most 1,800 in all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: No, you got it—with the greatest
respect either you are wrong or your office. According to the
note from Group X of your office:
<span class='pageno' title='71' id='Page_71'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“According to the data at my disposal the number of students
affected by the closure”—I should think that would include
high schools as well—“for 3 years of the Czech universities
is 18,998.</p>

<p>“According to the press communications, dated the 21st of
this month only 1,200 persons were arrested in connection
with the events of the 15th of this month.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then your office goes on to say by a process of subtraction
that leaves 17,800. You were faced with their occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it is Page 104, Document 3858-PS. Exhibit GB-523.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not want to deny my official’s statement.
He must have known better than I. I am merely surprised that
there should have been 18,000 students in two Czech universities,
in a country with a population of 7 millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Hadn’t you better check that by the original?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I shall. I am much
obliged to Your Lordship. Well, My Lord, it is quite clear that
both figures—they are in figures, and they are 18,998, and then there
is the check below, and you have to take off 1,200; that leaves 17,800.
My Lord, if it were only 1,800, the second figure could not arise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, somewhere there
must be an error. That would have been more for two universities
in Czechoslovakia than there were in Berlin at the best of times.
There was a maximum of 8,000 to 9,000 in Berlin per year and in
the case of a nation of only 7 millions there are supposed to be
18,000 students in two universities. This cannot be right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, it may be that there
are three age groups. Your Lordship sees that it is “according to
the data at my disposal, the number of students affected by the
closure for 3 years of the Czech universities is 18,000.” It may
be that is the intake for 2 years, in addition to present students.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Anyhow, this is the figure; and it is
this problem which has been dealt with by your Ministry. It may
be that it includes certain high schools, but at any rate, these are
your Ministry’s documents, and I want to know what happened.
This was the minutes, as I understand it, from Dennler, Dr. Dennler,
who was the head of Group X of your office, to Burgsdorff, who
had a superior position; and, if I may summarize it, this letter of
21 November 1939 suggests that the students should be taken forcibly
from Czechoslovakia to the old Reich and put to work in the
old Reich; and then, the next—on 25 November, you will notice
that in Paragraph 2 it says—the writer, who is Burgsdorff, is saying
that he is dealing with X 119/39, which is Dennler’s memorandum;
<span class='pageno' title='72' id='Page_72'></span>
and Burgsdorff says that he does not want them to go into the Reich
because at that time there was some unemployment in the Reich,
and suggests that they should be dealt with by compulsory labor
on the roads and canals in Czechoslovakia. Now, these were the two
proposals from your office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the second one is Document 3857-PS, which will be
Exhibit GB-524.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] What happened to the unfortunate
students?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Nothing at all happened to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well now, did either of these
proposals of Dr. Dennler for forced labor in the Reich and of Burgsdorff
for forced labor in Czechoslovakia, did they come up to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, none of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Did they come to you for decision?
Did they come to you for decision?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I think they were submitted to me, but I cannot
tell you for certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, will you agree with me,
or perhaps you will be able to correct my knowledge, that this is
the earliest suggestion—you said it was not put into effect—but the
earliest suggestion of forced labor came from an officer of your
department? Do you know of any other department of the Reich
that had suggested forced labor as early as November 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: There is no connection, and, moreover, if you
were to look through suggestions made by all your subordinates,
then you, too, might find some proposal which you afterward
rejected. Suggestions made by an adviser do not mean anything
at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that, perhaps I can clear up this figure of 18,000.
Here it says, “According to the data at my disposal, the number
of students who will be affected by closing the Czech universities
for 3 years will be 18,000.” It is, therefore, three times 6,000, is it
not? Which is approximately 18,000.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I had already put forward that
suggestion, Defendant, about 10 minutes ago, but I respectfully
agree with you. That is one matter in which we are not in
difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well now, you understand what I am suggesting. It is that these
proposals germinated in your office, because they were quite in
keeping with the proposals in the memoranda which I have just read
to the Tribunal, that you should not only get rid of Czech higher
<span class='pageno' title='73' id='Page_73'></span>
education, but you should have forced labor. Do you remember that
was in the State Secretary’s memorandum? What I am suggesting
is that it was in your department—the idea of forced labor—as
early as 21 November 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Defendant, I have only one other matter, and I hope, as it
is a question of fact, that perhaps you will be able to agree with
me on reflection. You suggested this morning that the German
university in Prague was closed down after the founding of Czechoslovakia
in 1919. That is how it came to us. On reflection, do you
not know that it continued and that many thousands of students
graduated in the German university of Prague between 1919 and
1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: As far as I know, it was a department of the
Czech university, a German part of the Czech university, as far as
I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: But it continued—it continued
as a university?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, it continued, but as a Czech university.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, but German students came
there and could take their degrees in German? It was a permitted
language? I suggest to you that there are thousands of people who
went there from Austria and from the old Reich—went there as
Germans and took their degrees in German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, only the old German university, the so-called
Charles University, was closed by the Czechs. But a German
department, or whatever one might call it, still remained. The
Germans studied and took their examinations there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think the point is clear. I am
not going to argue about the actual thing, but that there was a German
university, where German students could study, you will agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the Prosecution wish to cross-examine
further?</p>

<p class='pindent'>STATE COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE M. Y. RAGINSKY (Assistant
Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): Defendant, tell us please, when you
were Minister of Foreign Affairs did Ribbentrop try to intervene in
the foreign affairs of Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Is that a question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes, that is a question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Would you please tell us in
what form this intervention took place?
<span class='pageno' title='74' id='Page_74'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: By communicating to the Führer his own
ideas on foreign policy, without giving them to me for consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: All right. Yesterday you stated
here that in 1936 you had differences of opinion with Hitler and
that on 27 of July 1936 you asked to be relieved of your duties as a
Minister. This document was cited here yesterday, but did you not
write to Hitler then?—and I will read the last sentence of your letter
to him:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Even if I am no longer Minister, I shall be constantly at
your disposal, if you so desire, with my advice and my years
of experience in the field of foreign policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you write these words in your letter to the Führer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes indeed; yes indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: And did you fulfill the promises
you made to Hitler? Whenever it was necessary to cover by
diplomatic manipulations the aggressive actions of Hitler, as for
instance at the time of the annexation of the Sudetenland, during
the invasion of Czechoslovakia, and so on? Did you help Hitler with
your experience? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That is a great mistake. On the contrary, as
I have stated here yesterday and today, I was called in by Hitler
only once; and that was on the last phase of the Austrian Anschluss.
With that my activities came to an end, but in 1938, to be sure,
I went to see him of my own accord, to restrain him from starting
the war. That was my activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: We have already heard this.
I would like to ask you another question concerning the memorandum
of Friderici without repeating what has already been said
here concerning it. You remember this memorandum well, as it
was just presented to the Court a short time ago. In the last part
of the memorandum of Friderici—it is the last paragraph but one—it
is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If the governing of the Protectorate were in reliable hands
and guided exclusively by the order of the Führer of the 16th
of March 1939, the territory of Bohemia and Moravia would
become an integral part of Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It was for this purpose that Hitler chose you to be Protector; is
that not so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not a bit; that was not the reason at all. The
reason was—I have described it in detail yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: All right. We shall not repeat
the reasons; we spoke about them yesterday.
<span class='pageno' title='75' id='Page_75'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, you deny that you were precisely the man who was
supposed to carry through the invasion of Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: To that I can only answer “no.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: All right. Do you admit that
you were, in the Protectorate, the only representative of the Führer
and of the Government of the Reich, and that you were directly
subordinate to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is right; that is stated in Hitler’s
decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes, it is stated there. I will
not read this decree, which would only delay the interrogation. This
decree has already been presented to the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you acknowledge that all administrative organs and authorities
of the Reich in the Protectorate with the exception of the Armed
Forces, were subordinate to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. I am sorry to have to say that that is a
mistake. That is also stated in the same decree of 1 September 1939.
Apart from that, there were numerous other organizations, that is,
Reich authorities, which were not under my jurisdiction; quite apart
from the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well, as far as the Police are
concerned, we will speak about that separately. So you think it is
a mistake that the decree does not mention it, or do you interpret
the decree otherwise?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall read the first paragraph of the decree of 1 September
1939. It is stated there:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“All the authorities, offices and organizations of the Reich in
the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, with the exception
of the Armed Forces, are under the jurisdiction of the Reich
Protector.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>It is also stated in Paragraph 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reich Protector supervises the entire autonomous administration
of the Protectorate.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And Paragraph 3:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The office of the Reich Protector is in charge of all administrative
branches of the Reich administration with the
exception of the Armed Forces.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As you see, it is stated very bluntly and definitely here that all
the institutions of the Reich were subordinate to you, while you
were subordinate to Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have to tell you again that as to administrative
agencies, yes; but there were a number of other
<span class='pageno' title='76' id='Page_76'></span>
authorities, Reich authorities and offices which did not come under
my jurisdiction, for instance, the Four Year Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Now let us pass to the question
of the Police. Yesterday, in answer to a question of your
counsel, you stated to the Tribunal that as to this decree of 1 September,
signed by Göring, Frick, and Lammers, Paragraph 13 was
not comprehensible to you. Let us examine other paragraphs of the
same chapter concerning the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 11 says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The organs of the German Security Police in the Protectorate
of Bohemia and Moravia have the task of investigating and
combating all hostile attempts toward the government and
population in the territory of the Protectorate, informing the
Reich Protector as well as the subordinate organizations,
keeping them currently informed on important events, and
advising them as to what to do.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Paragraph 14 of the same decree states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reich Minister of the Interior (the Reichsführer SS, and
the Chief of the German Police), with the agreement of the
Reich Protector in Bohemia and Moravia releases the legal
and administrative directives necessary for carrying out this
order.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, according to this decree, the Police and the SS were obliged
to let you know about all their measures and, moreover, all their
administrative and legal acts and measures had been carried out
with your knowledge. Do you acknowledge that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No; that is not right. First of all, there was
at one time an order that they were to inform me. But that was not
carried out and was forbidden by Himmler directly. And the other,
the second regulation to the effect that the administrative measures—or
whatever it is called—could or should be carried out
with my approval, was never applied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: So you deny it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I now present to you the
testimony of Karl Hermann Frank, of 7 March 1946, on this very
question; that is, on the question of the Police and to whom they
were subordinated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I present this testimony as Exhibit Number
USSR-494.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is this in the English book as well, do you
know?
<span class='pageno' title='77' id='Page_77'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: No, Mr. President. This document
that I am presenting now is an original, signed by Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Karl Hermann Frank, during an
interrogation, testified:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“According to the order on ‘The Structure of the German
Administration in the Protectorate and the German Security
Police,’ all German authorities and offices in the Protectorate
and thereby the entire Police, too, excepting the Armed
Forces are formally subordinated to the Reich Protector and
are bound by his directions. Owing to this the Security Police
was bound to carry out this basic political policy set forth by
the Reich Protector. Orders as to carrying out State Police
measures were mainly issued by the Chief of the Security
Police with the Reich Security Main Office in Berlin.</p>

<p>“If the Reich Protector wanted to carry out some State Police
measures, he had to have the permission of the Reich Security
Main Office in Berlin; that is, in this case the State Police also
submitted each order for reconfirmation to the Reich Security
Main Office in Berlin. The same applied also to directives for
the carrying out of State Police measures given by the Higher
SS and Police Leader to the Chief of the Security Police.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to draw your attention to this paragraph that I am
reading now:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This system of channels for issuing directives remained in
force during the whole existence of the Protectorate and was
used as such by Von Neurath in the Protectorate. In general
the Reich Protector could, on his own initiative, issue
directives to the State Police through the Chief of the Security
Police. The carrying out of such directives was, however,
subject to approval by the Reich Security Main Office if
State Police measures were concerned.</p>

<p>“In regard to the SD (Security Service), which had no
executive powers, the authority of the Reich Protector
respecting the issuing of directives to the SD was greater and
not subject to the approval of the Reich Security Main Office
in every case.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you confirm this testimony of Frank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: All right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I refer you to a statement by the same Frank,
which I have learned about here, which was made last year, during
which he said something quite different. He said that the entire
Police were not under the Reich Protector, but came under the Chief
<span class='pageno' title='78' id='Page_78'></span>
of the Police in Berlin, namely, Himmler. It ought to be here
somewhere—this statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Don’t worry about it; I will
come back to this testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Tell me, please, who was the political adviser in your service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Political adviser?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes, political adviser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In general I had various political advisers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: In order not to waste time, I
will show you a short document, and I ask you to read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 21 July 1939 the Chief of the Security Police wrote a letter
to your State Secretary and Higher SS and Police Leader, Karl
Hermann Frank. The letter had the following contents:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In an order of 5 May 1939 the Reich Protector of Bohemia
and Moravia appointed the SD Leader and Chief of the
Security Police as his political adviser. I have ascertained
that this order has not yet been published or carried out.
Please provide for carrying out this order.</p>

<p>“Signed, Dr. Best.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember your order now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I cannot remember that decree at the moment,
but I do remember that this was never carried out, because I did
not have this SD leader as my political adviser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This would be a convenient time to break off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, just one more
minute, please, to finish this question, and then we can break off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] But did you issue such an order on
5 May?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can no longer tell you about that at this
date—but it is probably true. I do not want to deny it; I do not
know any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: But you did issue this order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>All right. I thank you, Mr. President. It is possible to adjourn
now. I shall require 30 minutes more.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 26 June 1946, at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='79' id='Page_79'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FOURTH DAY</span><br/> Wednesday, 26 June 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will not sit on Thursday, tomorrow
afternoon, in open session, but will sit in closed session. That
is to say, we will sit tomorrow, Thursday, from 10 till 1 in open
session, and we will sit in the afternoon in closed session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Saturday morning, the Tribunal will sit in open session from
10 till 1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I am aware that
yesterday when I submitted the Document USSR-494, the necessary
copies of this document were not submitted to the Tribunal. I am
very sorry about this, and I would ask you to accept the necessary
copies now which I am going to submit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Von Neurath resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us go back, Defendant, to your warning issued in August
1939. If I understood you correctly, you said here before the Tribunal
that this warning was issued in connection with the military
situation of the time; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: With reference to the military situation nothing
had happened at that time; absolutely no political tension had become
noticeable in the meantime; therefore, it was not directly in
connection with the military situation. There was certainly nothing
wrong yet at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: That is regardless of the military
situation, all right. Do you acknowledge that by this order of
yours, or by this warning, you had introduced a system of hostages?
Do you admit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not understand the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I am going to repeat the question.
I am asking you, do you acknowledge that by means of this
warning of August 1939—I am submitting this document as evidence
under Document Number USSR-490—that by this order you
were setting up a system of hostages? Do you admit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not understand.
<span class='pageno' title='80' id='Page_80'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Was it correctly translated to
you just now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes; the translation did not come through on
the last question, or rather the last sentence. I did not understand
the last sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well, I will put it to you that
you know the document well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes; but I did not understand the last sentence
of your question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I shall try to say it in such a
way that you will understand it now. In this order of yours, in the
penultimate paragraph, it is stated, “The responsibility for all acts
of sabotage will be borne not only by the individual perpetrators,
but by the entire Czechoslovak population.” This means that not
only guilty persons have to be punished, but there were punishments
set up for innocent people too. With this order you inaugurated
the mass terrorism against the Czech population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not at all. It only meant that the moral responsibility
for any possible acts was to be laid to the account of the
Czech people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well, in Lidice, was this not
applied in practice? Was it only a question of the moral responsibility
there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: In this order you state the following:
“Those who do not take these necessities into account will
be considered enemies of the Reich.” To the enemies of the Reich
you applied only the principles of moral responsibility and nothing
else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, if someone did not obey orders, then
naturally he was punished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: That is exactly what I am
trying to determine and that is why I put this question to you, that
just by this order of August 1939 you started the general terrorism
of a massacre and punishment of innocent people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well, I do not know how you can draw this
conclusion from this warning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: We are going now to the deductions
which we can make out of this. In the report of the Czechoslovak
Government, submitted as evidence, Document USSR-60,
which is a report on the final result of the investigation of the crimes
committed by you and your collaborators, all this has been stated.
<span class='pageno' title='81' id='Page_81'></span>
And you just flatly deny all this documentary evidence. I am not
going to argue with you regarding this document, but I am going
to read into the record some of the testimony by the witnesses; and
I would like you to reply whether you corroborate this evidence or
whether you deny it. I am going to read into the record an excerpt
from the testimony of the former Minister of Finance, Josef Kalfus,
of 8 November 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will find these excerpts on Page 12 of the English
text, Document USSR-60.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kalfus stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The economic system introduced by Neurath and after him
by the later German regime, was nothing else than systematic,
organized robbery. As to the occupation of decisive
positions in the Czech industry and finance, it should be
pointed out that, together with Neurath, a vast economic
machinery was installed, which immediately occupied the
chief positions in industry. The Skoda Works, Brno Armament
Works, steel works at Vitkovice, important banks—Bohemian
Discount Bank, Länder Bank, and Bohemian Union
Bank—were occupied as well.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you corroborate this evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I talked about this matter in great detail
yesterday, and I refer you to my statement I made yesterday. I
have nothing to add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Thus, you do not corroborate
this evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not in the least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: The former, President of Bohemia,
Richard Bienert, during the interrogation of 8 November
1945, stated—Mr. President, this excerpt is on Page 13 of the English
text of the Document USSR-60:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When we got to know him more closely, we noticed that he,
Neurath, was ruthless toward the Czechs. As the Landespräsident
of Bohemia I knew that it was Neurath who subjected
the political administration in Bohemia and Moravia
to German control, both the state administration and the local
government as well. I remember also that Neurath caused the
abolition of the local school counsellors, and the appointment
of German school inspectors in their place. Neurath ordered
the dissolution of the regional representative bodies; he caused
Czech workers to be sent to the Reich from April 1939 onward
in order to work for the war machine of the Reich. He ordered
the closing down of the Czech universities and of many Czech
secondary and elementary schools.
<span class='pageno' title='82' id='Page_82'></span></p>

<p>“He abolished the Czech sport clubs and associations, such as
Sokol and Orel, and ordered the confiscation of all the property
of these gymnastic organizations; he abolished ... the Czech
recreation homes and sanatoria for young workmen and
students, and ordered the confiscation of their property. The
Gestapo carried out the arrests, but on the order of the Reich
Protector ... I myself was arrested on 1 September 1939, as
well.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Will you still deny this testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, no. About all the matters which are listed
here, I spoke yesterday in great detail. I do not intend to repeat it
all over again now. Moreover, it seems strange to me that Mr. Bienert
of all people, who knew perfectly well what I had ordered and
what my relations were to the Gestapo and so forth, that Mr. Bienert
of all people should say things like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well. Let us look at some
other testimony. The former Prime Minister of the so-called Protectorate,
Dr. Krejci, during the interrogations on 8 November 1945,
stated...</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this excerpt can be found on Page 17 of the English
text of the Document USSR-60. Krejci testified:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I know that the gymnastic associations were disbanded and
their property confiscated at the order of the Reich Protector,
and their funds and equipment handed over to be used by German
associations such as SS, SA, Hitler Youth, and so on. On
1 September 1939, when Poland was attacked by the German
Army, arrests took place on a large scale, especially arrests
of army officers, intellectuals, and important political personalities.
The arrests were made by the Gestapo, but it
could not be done without the approval of the Reich Protector.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am reading into the record one more excerpt from the next
page of the testimony:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“As far as the Jewish problem was concerned, the Government
of the Protectorate was forced by the Reich Protector
into a campaign against the Jews, and when this pressure
had not the desired result, the Germans—or the Reich Protector’s
office—started persecuting the Jews according to the
German laws. The result was that tens of thousands of Jews
were persecuted and lost their lives and property.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Are you going to deny this testimony, too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: With reference to the order which you mentioned
at the beginning, concerning the sport clubs, I have to tell
you that that was a police measure which I had not ordered; and
<span class='pageno' title='83' id='Page_83'></span>
I go on to repeat, as I said yesterday, that the arrests at the beginning
of the war were carried out by the Gestapo, by direct order
from Berlin, without my even having heard about the matter. I did
not learn about it until afterward. Finally, with reference to the
Jewish problem which is mentioned in the end, the statement which
is contained in the Indictment, I think, namely, that I had attempted
to get the Government of Czechoslovakia to introduce anti-Jewish
laws, is an incorrect statement. I, or rather my State Secretary,
talked to Mr. Elias, as far as I know. I myself have never talked to
him. I talked to Mr. Hacha only afterward on a later occasion, when
there was an attempt to introduce racial laws with reference to the
Czechs; Mr. Hacha objected to this and I told him he did not have
to do this, as this was my responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The introduction of the anti-Jewish laws was carried out by a
decree of mine, to be sure, because as early as the beginning of
April 1939, I had received orders to introduce the anti-Jewish legislation
in the Protectorate which was not incorporated in the Reich.
I delayed this step until July by means of all sorts of inquiries in
Berlin, so as to give time to the Jews to prepare themselves in some
way or other. These are the actual facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Tell me, do you know Dr. Havelka?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I know Herr Havelka, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: He knew exactly about your
conversation with Hacha?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well, how much he knew about that, I do not
know. Herr Havelka came to see me once or twice. He was Transport
Minister, I think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes, that is quite correct. He
was the Minister of Transport, but before that, he was the head of
the chancellery of Hacha’s office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Havelka, during his interrogation on 9 November last year, gave
the following testimony, which can be found on Pages 18 and 19 of
the English text of Exhibit USSR-60—I am quoting an excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He”—Neurath—“was not interested in the Czech nation and
interventions of Cabinet members and Dr. Hacha pressing
Czech demands were on the whole without any result.</p>

<p>“There were the following actions in particular:</p>

<p>“Arrests of Czechoslovak officers, intelligentsia, members of
the Czechoslovak Legion of the first World War, and politicians.
At the time of the attack on Poland by the German
Army about six to eight thousand persons were arrested.
They were hostages. The Germans themselves called them
‘held in protective custody.’ The majority of those hostages
<span class='pageno' title='84' id='Page_84'></span>
were never interrogated, and all steps taken at the office of
the Reich Protector in favor of these unfortunate men remained
without any result.</p>

<p>“Neurath, as the only representative of the Reich Government
in the territory of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia,
was responsible for the execution of nine students on 17 November
1939. The execution was carried out soon after...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Raginsky, would it not be better and
perhaps fairer to the defendant to ask him one question at a time?
You are reading long passages of these documents which contain
many questions. Perhaps you could take these two paragraphs you
read now about the arrest of officers and ask him whether he says
those are true or untrue, and then go on to the other paragraphs
you want. It is very difficult for him to answer a great number of
questions at one time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, he has these
documents before him and he is acquainted with the testimonies in
question, but I will take into consideration what you have just told
me. I will speak about the shooting of the students separately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Do you corroborate this part of the
evidence which I have just read into the record regarding the
hostages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: About the arrest of the members of the so-called
Vlayka, at the beginning of September 1939, I have spoken
earlier, and I spoke in detail about that yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I said that these arrests—I am repeating it once more—were
carried out by the Gestapo without my knowledge. Herr Havelka’s
statement, that no steps had been taken in the interest of these
people, is untrue. He ought to know that I continuously fought for
these people and that a large number of them were released through
my efforts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well, let us go over to
another question. Here, before this Tribunal, a certain document
has already been introduced several times under Document Number
USSR-223. This is the diary of Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I am not referring to Karl Hermann Frank, who
was sentenced to die for his crimes, but it is the Defendant Frank
that I am speaking about. This excerpt has already been quoted
here, but I should like to put a question to the defendant about it.
I shall read it into the record. During an interview with a correspondent
of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> in 1942, the Defendant Frank
stated as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In Prague, for instance, some red placards were put out saying
that seven Czechs were being shot that day. Then I told
<span class='pageno' title='85' id='Page_85'></span>
myself if I had to issue an order for such placards to be put
up regarding every seven Poles who were shot, then there
would not be enough timber in Poland to manufacture enough
paper for such placards.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Please tell me if it is true that such red placards were put up
in Prague?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I mentioned that yesterday. I have already
said yesterday that this was the poster where my signature was
misused, and that I had not seen it in advance. That is that red
poster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well, if you have not seen
these posters, will you please look at them. We are going to show
it to you right now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I know it very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Raginsky, he did not say he had not
seen it. He said it was put up without his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I am going to
come back to this, but I should like to establish that these were the
red posters which were mentioned by Frank in his diary, and I
should like to submit this poster under Document Number USSR-489.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to read it into the record; it is very short and it
will not take much time. The text is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In spite of repeated serious warnings, a number of Czech
intellectuals, in collaboration with <span class='it'>émigré</span> circles abroad, are
trying to disturb peace and order in the Protectorate of Bohemia
and Moravia by committing major or minor acts of
resistance. In this connection it was possible to prove that the
ringleaders of these resistance acts are especially to be found
in the Czech universities. Since on 28 October and 15 November
these elements gave way to acts of physical violence
against individual Germans, the Czech universities have been
closed for the duration of 3 years, nine of the perpetrators
have been shot, and a considerable number of the participants
have been arrested.</p>

<p>“Signed, The Reich Protector of Bohemia and Moravia, Freiherr
von Neurath, Prague, 17 November 1939.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>You state here that you never signed this warning? Have I
understood you rightly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, indeed. I have already explained yesterday
or the day before how this came about, namely, in my absence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well, you should not repeat
what you have already stated.
<span class='pageno' title='86' id='Page_86'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I am going to read into the record a certain statement by Karl
Hermann Frank of 26 November 1945, connected with the subject.
It can be found on Pages 46 and 47 of the Russian text. The English
text will be submitted. Karl Hermann Frank, giving evidence
regarding this poster, the text of which I have just read into the
record, stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This document was dated 17 November 1939 and was signed
by Von Neurath who did not object either to the shooting of
the nine students...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, may I draw your
attention to something connected with this document. The document
is neither dated nor is it signed, at least not the copy I have.
It does not make it at all clear from whom the document originates,
and I should like to take this opportunity to protest against the
reading of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, is there not a certificate
about the document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Not in my copy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, will you permit
me to explain this misunderstanding. Dr. Von Lüdinghausen has the
full text of the Document USSR-60. The English text was also submitted
to the Tribunal. This document was quoted yesterday by
Dr. Lüdinghausen. There is a certificate regarding the authenticity
of this document signed by the plenipotentiary of the Czechoslovak
Government, and there is the date, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, just to facilitate the proceedings, we have submitted another
copy of Frank’s testimony to Dr. Lüdinghausen, and it would be very
easy to determine that there is a certificate regarding the authenticity
of this statement which is dated 17 November...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I should like to say the following
about this point: When I received this long indictment from Colonel
Ecer of the Czech Delegation, the document did not have any additions
or appendices, except texts of laws. I therefore endeavored to
obtain these additions because reference had been made to them.
I then received only one annex to an appendix, or supplement
“Number 2”; the others I received in the same condition as the one
which I have here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, will you wait a
minute? Will you kindly tell us what document it is you are referring
to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: It is USSR-60.
<span class='pageno' title='87' id='Page_87'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: USSR-60—well, that is the Czech report, is
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: That is the Czech report, which is
about this thick [<span class='it'>indicating</span>] in German; that is the one in question.
Annexes have also been issued to this, and these annexes, I repeat,
were not made available to me; that is, I made a personal effort
to get them, but I received only one which is not identical with this
document and which I received much later and in the same condition
as that which I hold in my hand now, that is to say, without
a heading, without a signature, and without a date, and most certainly
without any certificate as to when, where, and by whom this
supposed statement of Frank’s was taken down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let us hear what General Raginsky has got
to say about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I understand General Raginsky, he says there is a certificate
identifying that document and what is being supplied to you is
merely a copy, which may not have the date and may not have the
certificate on it, but which is the same as the document which is
certified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is that what you said, General Raginsky?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Could you now show Dr. Von Lüdinghausen
the certificate and the document which is certified?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: This certificate can be found
on Page 44 of the Russian text in the appendix to Document USSR-60
and it is signed for General Ecer by Colonel of the General Staff
Corps, Novack. This certificate was submitted, in due course, by us
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to take up the time of the Tribunal
about this particular document? It seems to me we are wasting
a lot of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: After all, it is important. Otherwise
I cannot find out whether it is genuine. That is certainly
my right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I was asking General Raginsky whether he
wanted to persist in the use of the document. Is it worth while?
I do not know what the document is or what it says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I consider that is not necessary,
because this document has already been submitted to the Tribunal
a few months ago and accepted by the Tribunal as evidence. I really
do not understand the statements by Dr. Von Lüdinghausen.
<span class='pageno' title='88' id='Page_88'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why do you not show Dr. Von Lüdinghausen
that there is a certificate which applies to the document which you
put in his hand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Yes, certainly, Mr. President.
I am holding in my hand the Russian text of the certificate. I am
quoting the Russian text and I can present it to Dr. Von Lüdinghausen
so that he can be convinced. The original document has
been submitted to the Tribunal and is in the possession of the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, is there not a German translation of
the certificate and does not the certificate identify the document?
Is there a German translation of the certificate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Just at the moment I do not
have it, but during the intermission I shall be glad to produce the
original German document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, the Tribunal is told
that this document was put in before and the certificate of General
Ecer was put in at the same time, certifying that this document is
a part of the Czech report. In those circumstances, the Tribunal
will allow the document to be used.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, then I have another
objection to the use of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As is known, if any interrogation transcripts or affidavits from
witnesses are presented, the Defense have the right to summon these
witnesses for an interrogation. The former State Secretary Frank,
who has made this statement, is, however, as is known, no longer
among the living. Therefore, I also object for this reason to the use
of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, this document was
offered and accepted in evidence during the lifetime of this man,
K. H. Frank. That is one reason for accepting it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document is admissible under Article 21 of the Charter and
was submitted under that article and there is no such rule as you
have stated, that the Defense are entitled to cross-examine every
person who makes an affidavit. It is a matter entirely within the
discretion of the Tribunal and therefore that objection is rejected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I do not want to
hold you any longer on this matter but I wanted to show that this
was an unnecessary delay as Dr. Von Lüdinghausen used the
document himself to introduce some extracts from the testimony of
Frank in his document book.
<span class='pageno' title='89' id='Page_89'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I shall read into the record some statements made by Frank.
This document, I repeat, is in connection with the warning dated
17 November 1939 which we just exhibited to this Tribunal, and
signed by Von Neurath, who did not raise his voice either against
the shooting of the nine students nor as to the number of students
who were to be sent to concentration camps, and he did not really
request any changes in this legislation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Did you hear the testimony, Defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I have read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Do you deny this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: But most definitely. There was no possibility
whatever of my doing so because I was not in Prague and consequently
I could neither have had any knowledge of it, nor could
I have signed it or passed it on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well. You still insist on
stating that the Police never informed you regarding the arrests
which were made and other police measures which were taken? Do
you state that firmly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not say that they never informed me, but
that they always informed me afterward. My information always
came from Czech sources.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Was not the state of affairs
such that the Police regularly reported to you regarding the important
events which took place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Not at all. In particular I never learned anything
about what they were planning, at least not until afterward—or
if I had learned it from Czech sources and then made inquiries
with the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well. I am going to read
an extract from the testimony of Karl Hermann Frank, dated 7 March
1946. This testimony was submitted by me to the Tribunal yesterday
and it was partially read by me already. Will you give a copy
of the testimony, USSR-494, to the defendant, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frank states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Reich Protector, Von Neurath, regularly received reports
on the most important events in the Protectorate which had
some bearing on the Security Police, from me, from the State
Secretary, as well as from the Chief of the Security Police.
For example, Von Neurath was informed in the special case
concerning the student demonstrations in November 1939 both
by me and by the Chief of the Security Police. This case dealt
with Hitler’s direct orders demanding the shootings of all the
<span class='pageno' title='90' id='Page_90'></span>
ringleaders. The number of ringleaders was to be fixed by
the Prague Stapo and the Reich Protector was informed about
this. In this case an estimate on the number of the ringleaders
was left to the discretion of the State Police, or rather
to the approval of the Reich Protector. Reich Protector Von
Neurath signed the official dispatch announcing the execution
of these students, thereby approving this action. It can therefore
not be said that in this case the Reich Protector was
merely responsible for the carrying out of the general Hitler
order which deals with the execution of all ringleaders, but
that he is also responsible for the fixing of the number of
ringleaders, namely nine. I informed him in detail about the
interrogation and he signed the poster.</p>

<p>“If this had not met with his approval and had he wished to
revise it, as for instance, making it less severe, which he had
the right to do, then I should have had to abide by his
decision.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now do you deny these statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes; I do not know how many times I have
got to tell you that I was not in Prague at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And besides I do not know under what sort of pressure Frank
might have made these statements. It does not give the date, but
you just said that he made this statement on 7 April, and therefore
a few days before his execution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I should like the Tribunal to
note that the defendant is deliberately distorting the facts. I repeated
several times that these statements were made by Frank on
7 March and not on 7 April, or 2 days before the execution, as you
are telling me now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document is before you and you can look at it yourself and
see the date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: All right, then 7 March instead of 7 April. I
think I said 7 April because I did not see the date at the top. But
as I have said—I think I have already told you three times—I could
not have known anything at all about it because I was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Well. But you are making too
many mistakes. Yesterday when giving testimony you were not
very clear as to the number of students, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I cannot remember what I said yesterday, but
I could hardly have made so many mistakes; I do not know if there
were one or two less.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I would like to remind you.
Yesterday, in reply to a question by Sir David, who submitted to
<span class='pageno' title='91' id='Page_91'></span>
you Document 3858-PS, from which it was evident that after the
closing of the higher institutions of learning, 18,000 students found
themselves out of school...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to go over Sir David’s cross-examination
again? Surely we have said that we do not want to
go over the same subject twice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I do not want to
go back to the very same thing, and I do not want to add anything
to the questions put by Sir David who has carried out a very
detailed interrogation. I wanted only to establish the truth. When
the defendant stated yesterday that in the document which was submitted
by Sir David there was a mistake—that in Prague there
existed only two institutions of higher learning and that 12,000
students could not have been arrested, this was not correct. The
question was not merely about the closing of two Prague universities,
but, on the basis of the order of 17 November 1939, there
were closed the Czech university in Prague, the Czech university
in Brünn, the Czech Higher Technical School in Brünn, the Czech
Higher Technical School in Prague...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We heard all this yesterday, and we do not
want to hear it again. We heard all about the closing of the university
in Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well, Mr. President. I
just wanted to state that not 2 universities were closed, but 10 institutions
of higher learning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have just a few questions left which I should like to put to the
defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] You received many awards from
Hitler, as is evident from the documents, and as you yourself stated.
For instance, on 22 September 1940 you received the Iron Cross for
Military Service. For what kind of services did you receive this
award from Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Surely we went into this yesterday, did we
not, in Sir David’s cross-examination, or in the examination-in-chief,
I forget which? I think it was the examination-in-chief—all
these decorations which were given the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I do not want to
revert to these orders, but I should like to ask the defendant, for
what special services he received the Iron Cross from Hitler in 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right, ask him that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Unfortunately, I cannot tell you. I cannot tell
you what sort of merits I am supposed to have displayed. The award
<span class='pageno' title='92' id='Page_92'></span>
of this order of merit was made generally to all higher officials who
were in service at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well, I am not going to
insist on your reply. I just wanted to state here that you received
this award in 1940 after the mass terror was applied against the
Czechoslovak population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not know that I am supposed to have carried
out a mass terror.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Very well, if you do not understand,
we are not going to argue about this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In February 1943, in connection with your jubilee, various articles
about you were published in many newspapers. I am not going to
submit all these papers to the Tribunal or quote these articles, but
I should like to read just two excerpts from the newspaper <span class='it'>Fränkischer
Kurier</span> of 2 February 1943. We shall submit to you one of
the copies of this so that you can follow me as I read this document
into the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This newspaper is being submitted to the Tribunal under Document
Number USSR-495.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with your anniversary, it was stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The most outstanding events in the field of foreign policy
after Hitler’s coming to power, in which Freiherr von Neurath
played a most important role as Reich Foreign Minister and
with which his name will always be connected, are: Germany’s
leaving the Geneva Disarmament Conference...the
reuniting of the Saar to Germany...and the denouncing of
the Locarno Pact.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And further on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Reich Protector Freiherr von Neurath was repeatedly decorated
by the Führer for outstanding services in the interest
of the people and the Reich. He was decorated with the Golden
Party Badge of Honor, received the rank of SS Gruppenführer,
was a knight of the Order of the Eagle, and received
the Gold Badge of Honor for Faithful Service for his 40 years
of diplomatic service.</p>

<p>“In appreciation of his outstanding services in the field of
military efforts in the post of Reich Protector for Bohemia
and Moravia, the Führer decorated him with the Military
Cross, First Class.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Are the facts correctly stated in this article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: If I had to investigate the correctness of every
article written by some journalist or other, I would have had a lot
<span class='pageno' title='93' id='Page_93'></span>
to do. These statements are the opinion of a journalist and nothing
more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That was not the question. The question was
whether they were correctly stated, as a matter of fact. You can
answer that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes—no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which do you mean, “yes” or “no”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The decorations are correctly stated. Apart
from that it is not correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: I have no further questions
to put.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Lüdinghausen, do you wish to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, yesterday afternoon
I had the feeling and impression, probably not without reason, that
Herr Von Neurath was visibly tired and strained after the previous
examination and that he was no longer in a position to do complete
justice to the questions which were put to him. This, after all, is
not surprising, if one considers that Herr Von Neurath is in his
seventy-fourth year and besides that he is also suffering from a
fairly serious heart disease. I feel obliged, therefore, to refer back
to various points of the cross-examination of yesterday and put
a few questions to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Herr Von Neurath, you stated yesterday
that because of the excesses of the SA and other radical groups
in 1933 and later, you frequently protested to Hitler. What was the
reason why you remonstrated with Hitler directly and did not raise
your objections at the Cabinet meetings which were still taking place
at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I had already learned from personal experience
that Hitler could not stand contradiction of any kind and that he
was not amenable to any kind of petition if it was made before a
fairly large group, because then he would always develop the complex
that he was facing some sort of opposition against which he
had to defend himself. It was different when one confronted him
alone. Then, at least during the earlier years, he was accessible,
thoroughly amenable to reasonable arguments, and much could be
achieved in the way of moderating or weakening radical measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, I should like to mention again that just after the
excesses mentioned in Mr. Geist’s affidavit there was a meeting of
the Cabinet, during which strong protests were raised against the
repetition of such occurrences by various ministers including non-Nazi
ministers. At that time Hitler thoroughly agreed with these
objections, and declared that such excesses would not be allowed to
<span class='pageno' title='94' id='Page_94'></span>
recur. Shortly afterward he also made a speech in which he publicly
expressed an assurance to this effect. From then until June
1934 no more excesses took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: But in April 1933 there was the
well-known anti-Jewish boycott, which lasted 24 hours, if I am not
mistaken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that was one of Herr Goebbels’ provocations.
But actually there were no excesses and acts of violence
whatsoever on that occasion. It was confined merely to boycotting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, the fact that no further disturbances arose in that
case was the result of a joint intercession by Herr Von Papen and
myself with Hitler and especially with Hindenburg. A perfectly
correct description of this episode is to be found, as I recall, in an
article of <span class='it'>Time</span> for April 1933, which is also contained in my document
book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, it was submitted in
my document book, Document Number Neurath-9.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] In connection with the events that
occurred at that time, arrests, and so forth, Sir David yesterday
referred particularly to the arrest of the well-known author Ossietzski.
Do you recall that this Ossietzski had already been sentenced
to a fairly long prison term by a German court even before the
seizure of power?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I remembered that afterward. I remember
which government—Herr Ossietzski had been sentenced by a Reich
that even before the seizure of power—I do not know under
court to a fairly long term in the penitentiary for high treason, but
he had not yet served it, and consequently was arrested again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now I should like to ask you
another question with reference to the report submitted by the
Prosecution yesterday. It is the letter of Ministerial Director Köpke
on 31 May 1934. That is Document D-868. In this report, from the
information noted down by Herr Köpke, do you see any proof that
the Foreign Office was drawn into the subversive activities of the
Austrian Nazis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, not at all. This has to do with a report
which Ministerial Director Köpke made to me about a visit by Herr
Wächter, whom he described as an Austrian with a sense of responsibility.
This Herr Wächter had tried to establish a connection with
the Foreign Office and with Hitler in order to draw attention to the
dangers arising from the growing radicalism of the Austrian Nazis.
The head of the Political Department, Herr Köpke, identifies himself
with Wächter regarding these apprehensions and agreed to
make an oral report to that effect.
<span class='pageno' title='95' id='Page_95'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not think that anyone can doubt that my attitude was not
quite the same as that of Herr Köpke and I passed this report on
to Hitler in order to draw his attention to the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The Prosecution—or rather, Sir
David—referred yesterday to reports which deal with the treatment
of the Czech problem by you and Frank. This is Document 3859-PS,
a letter which you sent to the Chief of the Reich Chancellery, Lammers,
on 31 August 1940, for the preparation of your oral report to
Hitler. Were these reports, that is, the one drafted by Frank, identical
with the memorandum mentioned in the Friderici document of
15 October?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, apparently these are the same reports.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now, during your examination you
spoke about the Friderici document, which you said was based on
plans of the SS, various Party circles, and the Gauleiter of the
Lower Danube district, regarding a deportation of Czechs to the
Eastern Territories. You went on to say that in order to stop these
plans, which you yourself described as nonsensical, you had Frank
prepare this memorandum in which a less radical solution was
recommended, which later had also been approved to a certain
extent by Hitler; and that in reality nothing happened, which was
what you intended, and that the idea of incorporation had practically
been buried. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is true. This entire affair and the
origin of these memoranda are extremely difficult to explain. It can
be understood only from the entire domestic political development.
The efforts of the Gauleiter of the surrounding districts to divide
up the Protectorate had proceeded rather far. They had all submitted
memoranda and Herr Himmler backed them up. All these
memoranda envisaged a radical solution of these problems; that
meant there was reason to fear that Hitler would comply with the
wishes of these Gauleiter. In order to stop this I had to make
several proposals which I myself had said were impracticable, and
I identified myself with them primarily so as to declare them absurd
later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the only explanation of the origin of these memoranda.
I did not draft the memoranda myself, but that was done in my
office, in accordance, to be sure, with instructions given by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was, however, and I should like to emphasize this expressly,
a purely tactical maneuver to get at Hitler, because I was afraid
that he would follow the radical suggestions made by Himmler and
his associates. I did actually manage to get Hitler to issue a strict
order, which is what I had requested, to the effect that all these
plans were no longer to be discussed, but that only the so-called
<span class='pageno' title='96' id='Page_96'></span>
assimilation plan was left, which could be carried out only over a
period of years; and, as a matter of fact, nothing more happened,
and that was exactly what I was aiming at.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: A decree was submitted by the
Prosecution yesterday, which was issued to the German authorities
in the Protectorate, regarding the treatment to be given of the German-Czech
problem publicly. That is Document 3862-PS, dated
27 June 1941. Is that in any way connected with these memoranda
or the discussion you had with Hitler about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, it is most closely interconnected, and I
think I said so yesterday. In the following year the same agitation
started all over again for this Germanization and partitioning of the
Protectorate, and I opposed it, and, once the question was decided,
I prohibited it from being reopened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: A document was submitted yesterday,
USSR-487, the Chief of the Security Police, addressed to State
Secretary Frank, dated 21 July 1943, that is to say, after you had
resigned. From that document the Prosecution are attempting to
draw the conclusion that, in accordance with a decree dated 5 May
1939, you appointed the leader of the SA and Security Police in
Prague as your political expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In what way did the latter act in this capacity? Did he act
at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, he did not; that is just it. It is clearly
apparent from this letter of reminder, dated 21 July 1943, that he
never became at all active in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR RAGINSKY: Mr. President, I should like to
state here that the question was incorrectly put. This document is
not dated in the year 1943 or 1942, but it is dated 21 July 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: May I remark here that it makes no difference,
as nothing had happened. I did not appoint any political expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What measures followed Documents
3851-PS and 3858-PS, which were introduced yesterday by
the Prosecution, and which were proposals submitted by various
departments and department heads of your administration regarding
the utilization for labor of the students who became unemployed
through the closing down of the Czech universities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already told you yesterday that this
apparently concerned a proposal from an adviser which never even
reached me, but was rejected by my State Secretary before it got
to me. Just how I could possibly be held responsible for the contents
of a draft submitted by an adviser, I cannot understand.
<span class='pageno' title='97' id='Page_97'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now I should like to put one more
question to you regarding the German-Austrian agreement of July
1936. As is mentioned in a report by Dr. Rainer to Bürckel which
the Prosecution have already submitted—I refer to Document 812-PS—is
it correct that Hitler, immediately after the signing of that
agreement, had personally declared to Dr. Rainer and the Austrian
Nazi Leader Globocznik that this agreement of 11 July 1936 was
signed by him in all honesty and sincerity, and that the Austrian
National Socialists, too, should under all circumstances adhere
strictly to this agreement, and that they were to let themselves be
guided by him in their conduct toward the Austrian Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is correct. As I think I said to you
yesterday, I believe I can also remember that Rainer actually confirmed
it when he was here on the witness stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I would like to put a last question...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He answered these questions perfectly clearly,
according to his view, yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, I am all through now. I should
like to ask him only one more question in conclusion of the entire
examination of my client.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution and also Sir David
brought the following charge against you yesterday: They charged
that although by your own admission you were not in agreement
with the Nazi regime and its methods, and although you considered
many of the things that occurred reprehensible and immoral and
abhorred them, you did not resign, but remained in the Government.
Will you please explain that to us once more?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already mentioned in the beginning
that I had given my promise to Hindenburg to enter the Government
and to remain there as long as it was at all possible for me
to follow a course unfavorable to any use of violence and to protect
Germany from warlike entanglements. That was my task and
nothing else. But it was not only this promise I had given to Hindenburg,
but also my sense of duty, and my feeling of responsibility
toward the German people, to protect them from warlike entanglements
as long as it was at all possible, which bound me to this
office. Beside these considerations all my personal wishes, which
were quite different, had to take second place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Unfortunately, my power and influence as Foreign Minister did
not reach far enough to enable me to prevent pernicious and immoral
actions in other spheres, as for instance, that of domestic
<span class='pageno' title='98' id='Page_98'></span>
policy, although I did try in many cases, not least of all in the
Jewish question itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, I considered that my highest duty was to carry out
the work assigned to me and not try to escape it, even if in another
sphere where I had no influence, things occurred which hurt me
and my opinions very deeply.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There may be many people who have different ideas and a different
attitude than I. I experienced similar attacks when I placed
myself at the disposal of a Social Democrat Cabinet in the year 1919
after the first revolution; at that time, too, the strongest attacks and
the most serious accusations were made against me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yet you yourself have struggled
hard with your conscience, you have often told me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, of course I have. It is not easy to belong
to a government with whose tendencies you do not agree, and for
which one is to be made responsible later on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, this completes my
examination. I would suggest we adjourn now and then I might
be permitted to begin the examination of my witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, you have some questions to ask?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARTIN HORN (Counsel for Defendant Von Ribbentrop):
Mr. President, I ask permission for my client to be absent from the
session this afternoon and tomorrow, because I have important
questions to discuss with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Defendant Von Ribbentrop?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Von Ribbentrop, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED THOMA (Counsel for Defendant Rosenberg):
Mr. President, yesterday afternoon General Raginsky asked whether
Rosenberg interfered in Neurath’s foreign policy. The interpreter
just told me that she translated it wrongly. She translated it
“whether Ribbentrop interfered in Neurath’s policy.” This question,
therefore, has not been answered yet; consequently, I ask permission
to ask Baron von Neurath whether Rosenberg interfered
in Neurath’s foreign policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, in no way. I never talked to Rosenberg
about matters of foreign policy.
<span class='pageno' title='99' id='Page_99'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Then I ask that the transcript be corrected accordingly,
so it should not read “whether Ribbentrop interfered in Neurath’s
policies,” but “whether Rosenberg interfered in Neurath’s
policies.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The record will be corrected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Francis Biddle, Member for the United
States): I want to ask you just a very few questions. You will
remember that the Baroness von Ritter said that after the 5th of
November 1937 you recognized—I want to read it exactly:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When Herr Von Neurath had to recognize for the first time
from Hitler’s statement on 5 November 1937 that the latter
wanted to achieve his political aims by using force toward
neighboring states, this shook him so severely mentally that
he suffered severe heart attacks.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is a correct description, is it not, of what you then recognized?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The defendant nodded assent.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Now, you stated that you spoke
immediately after that meeting to General Beck and General
Von Fritsch. Do you remember?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And I think you said to Sir David
that you did not speak to the Defendant Göring. What I am asking
you now is whether you spoke of what Hitler had said to anyone
else during the next 2 or 3 months. Did you speak to anyone
in the Foreign Office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I spoke to my State Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And with whom else from the
Foreign Office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No one, for Hitler had laid down the condition
that silence should be preserved about all these meetings; and for
that reason I did not speak with my officials about them. They
knew nothing. They had learned nothing from the military men,
either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Did you speak to the Defendant
Von Papen when you saw him next?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. I believe I did not see him at all at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And did you discuss it with anybody
else before your resignation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.
<span class='pageno' title='100' id='Page_100'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Now, I have only one other
question. You recognized, did you not, that Himmler would use
methods which you would not approve of; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, but only gradually; that could not have
been foreseen from the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): That is just what I wanted to
know. When did you first realize that? When did you first begin,
just as well as you could tell? About when did you realize what
sort of man Himmler was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That was very difficult to recognize, because
Himmler had two faces; he was a perfect Janus; one could not see
immediately what his real thoughts were at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): I am not asking you what he was
like. If you would just try to remember, you certainly realized that
at some time. Did you know it in 1937? You knew it in 1937 or
1938? Certainly in 1938, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Probably in 1938, but it is hard for me to give
a date at the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): I do not want a specific date. My
point is that you knew it before you went to the Protectorate; you
knew what Himmler was before you went to the Protectorate, of
course? There is no question about that, is there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Major General I. T. Nikitchenko, Member for
the U.S.S.R.): Did you ever express yourself openly against the
policy of the Hitlerite Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I am sorry, but the translation was not good.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): In your explanations made
before the Tribunal you stated that you were not in agreement with
the policy of Hitler’s Government, either on individual questions or
taken as a whole, as well. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Did you ever express yourself
openly with a statement of your disagreement with Hitler’s
policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did so more than once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): In what manner was it,
then? I am asking you about your public statements, either in the
press or while addressing any meeting?
<span class='pageno' title='101' id='Page_101'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No. It was no longer possible either to have
a voice in the press, or to hold a meeting. It was quite out of the
question. I could only speak to Hitler personally or, at the beginning,
in the Cabinet in protest against this policy. There was no
freedom of the press any longer, any more than in Russia. In the
same way no meeting was possible. Consequently...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): I am not asking you about
Russia; I am asking you about your expressing your views publicly.
In other words, you never expressed them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And in that way nobody in
Germany could know, or did know, about the fact that you were
not in agreement with the policy on the part of Hitler’s Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I always expressed myself quite unmistakably
about it, but not in articles, nor in meetings either; but otherwise
I always expressed myself clearly about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Yes, but only in your <span class='it'>tête-à-tête</span>
with Hitler, only personally to Hitler. You said so, did
you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No; I tell you I said that to everyone who
would listen, but I could not do so in public meetings, in speeches,
or in articles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And you remained a member
of the Government in spite of the fact that you were not in
agreement with the Government’s policy; is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, for that very reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): In order to counteract his
policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Do you know the results of
Such counteracting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not understand that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): What were the results of
counteracting the policy of Hitler’s Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well, I am not in a position to give the details
on that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): In particular, as to the
question of aggression, were you against the joining of Germany
and Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='102' id='Page_102'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): The German Government,
in spite of this, joined Austria to Germany; is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I believe it has been clearly expressed here
that at the last moment Hitler did that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You were against the seizing
of Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And the German Government,
in spite of this, seized Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I was no longer a member of the Government
at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): But as a statesman whose
opinion should have been considered, you, of course, expressed your
opinion against it, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Always.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You were against the attack
on Poland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And in spite of that Germany
did attack Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I repeat, I was no longer a member of the
Government. I learned of it only at the last moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You were against the attack
on the U.S.S.R.?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, more so indeed; I always wanted the exact
opposite. I wanted co-operation with the Soviet Union, I said that
as early as 19...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And still Germany attacked
the Soviet Union?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Judging from your explanations,
Hitler must have known about your political opposition and
your disagreement with his policy; is it correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: He knew that very well, for I resigned in 1938
for that reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Yes. And you know how
Hitler made short work of his political opponents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: In the Reich, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And so far as you were
concerned, in spite of the fact that you sided with the opposition,
nothing happened; that is true, is it not?
<span class='pageno' title='103' id='Page_103'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): So far as you were concerned,
in spite of the fact that you declared yourself for the opposition,
nothing of the kind happened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, but I always expected it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And could you not tell us
whether Sir Nevile Henderson, in his book, the <span class='it'>Failure of a Mission</span>,
expressed the facts concerning you personally correctly or not? Do
you consider that Sir Nevile Henderson expressed the facts correctly
concerning you personally? Does he express them correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I must admit frankly that I read this book by
Sir Nevile Henderson only once, 3 or 4 years ago. I cannot remember
now what he said about me. I heard excerpts from it here once
or twice but I cannot say what he writes about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): But I assume that you are
familiar enough with the excerpts presented by your defense
counsel in his document book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Now, for instance, that
which is expressed in his excerpts so far as you are concerned, is
it correct or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I assume so, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): That is to say, it is correct.
And is it quite correct what he writes in reference to your
membership in the Party? He writes that “Baron von Neurath himself
remained in the regime of Hindenburg, and he was not a member
of the Nazi Party.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, I believe I have said so repeatedly here
in the last few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And further on he informs
us that “he (Neurath) became a member of the Party later.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I have already explained how that happened.
In 1937 I received a Golden Party Badge without my...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Yes, we have heard that
before, but is it true or not that you became a member of the Nazi
Party later, as Sir Nevile Henderson states?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No, I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): So this particular part is
not correct, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I received the Golden Party Badge with Hitler’s
statement that this involved no obligations towards the Party.
<span class='pageno' title='104' id='Page_104'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): We have heard this already.
That means that in Sir Nevile Henderson’s statements not everything
is true as far as your person is concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I do not know. With the best intentions I cannot
remember what Sir Nevile Henderson wrote about me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): And the last question I
have, which is in regard to your memorandum: I did not quite
understand the explanations which were given by you to Sir David
and later to your defense counsel. Now, in forwarding Frank’s
memorandum, in the letter addressed to Lammers, you wrote that
you considered this memorandum absolutely correct. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, that is true. I should also like to tell you
the reasons. This memorandum...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You already explained the
reasons before. I just wanted to establish the fact that you really
wrote this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Up to now I have not told the reason why I
wrote this to Lammers. The reason why I wrote to Lammers to
this effect was that he was the one who submitted this memorandum
to the Führer. So I had to write to the same effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There are two subjects I want to ask you
about and the first relates to the letter that you wrote on the 31st
of August 1940. That is the letter which General Nikitchenko has
just referred to; you remember that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you remember that you said in that
letter that you fully agreed with the memorandum which your
Secretary of State Frank had drawn up independently of you. He
said that “Germanization provides for the changing of the nationality
of racially suitable Czechs; and secondly, the expulsion of racially
unassimilable Czechs and of the intelligentsia who are enemies
of the Reich or special treatment for these and all destructive elements.”
My question is: What did you understand by “special treatment”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Well, as far as I read this extract at all at the
time, I had in no way ever thought of the term “special treatment”
as it has become known here during the Trial. I was certainly not
at all in agreement with this attitude of Frank as represented in the
report, and I only had the intention of frustrating this whole affair
in order to sidetrack it. The content of these reports was only
intended to present this to Hitler in Hitler’s language, or in the
language of Himmler and others, in order to dissuade him from it
later on.
<span class='pageno' title='105' id='Page_105'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was it not misleading to write to Herr Lammers
with the view that it should be put forward to Hitler, saying
that you fully agreed with the memorandum with which you did
not agree?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Mr. President, as things were, I could not
write to Lammers. I did not intend to carry out anything which is
written in there, but since Lammers was presenting this to Hitler,
I first had to tell him I agreed with it. Afterward I reported to
Hitler and gave him an explanation in a personal conference during
the meeting with Frank and Gürtner which has been mentioned here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then your answer is that you do not know
what was meant by “special treatment”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: No; in any case I did not know at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now, there is one other question that I should
like to put to you. You remember when you were called on the
11th of March 1938, at the time of the Anschluss with Austria, and
you wrote the letter of the 12th of March 1938, in answer to the
memorandum which you received from the British Government
through Sir Nevile Henderson. You knew Sir Nevile Henderson
quite well, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And in that letter you said this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It is untrue that the Reich used forceful pressure to bring
about this development; especially the assertion, which was
spread later by the former Chancellor, that the German
Government had presented the Federal President with a conditional
ultimatum, is pure invention. According to the ultimatum,
he had to appoint a proposed candidate as Chancellor
and form a Cabinet conforming to the proposals of the
German Government, otherwise the invasion of Austria by
German troops was held in prospect.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then you go on to say what you allege was the truth of the
matter. You know now, do you not, that your statements in that
letter were entirely untrue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: That did not come through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you heard any part of the question that
I was putting to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Unfortunately not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is a pity that you did not say so earlier.
Do you remember the 11th of March 1938 and being called in to
represent the Foreign Office, and you have told me just now that
you knew Sir Nevile Henderson quite well?
<span class='pageno' title='106' id='Page_106'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you remember the letter which you
wrote on the 12th of March 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you admitted to Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe
that the statements in that letter were untrue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Untrue, yes—not entirely. They are presented
incorrectly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What steps did you take to find out whether
or not they were true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I did not learn of the incorrectness of this
presentation until much later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is not an answer to my question. I said,
“What steps did you take to find out whether the statement was
correct?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: The statement which Hitler gave me I first
simply presumed to be true. I certainly could not check up on it in
any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why should you assume it to be true when
it was in contradiction of what the British Government had stated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I had no other knowledge of the events which
had occurred and therefore could only say what I knew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You had the letter, the protest from the
British Government, had you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You knew Sir Nevile Henderson perfectly
well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you then wrote this letter contradicting
the statements which had been made on behalf of the British Government;
that is right, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you took no steps to check the facts
which had been stated to you by Hitler? Will you answer that,
please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. Your Lordship, how was I to do that?
There was no one else who knew about it. It was only what Hitler
had commissioned me to tell the Foreign Office. The draft of this
note was drawn up by the Foreign Office according to the information
which I had received from Hitler. I had no other chance to
clear this up.
<span class='pageno' title='107' id='Page_107'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There were all the other persons who were
concerned with the matter whom you could have communicated
with, but your statement is that you did nothing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I can only repeat that I had no opportunity
to procure any other information. No one knew about it except
Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you telling the Tribunal that Göring did
not know about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Perhaps Göring knew about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is all. The defendant can return to the
dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I ask permission to
call the first witness, the former Ministerial Director, and head of
the political section in the Foreign Ministry, Dr. Köpke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Köpke took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GERHARD KÖPKE (Witness): Gerhard Köpke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat the oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Dr. Köpke, how long have you
known Herr Von Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: I have known Herr Von Neurath for over 40 years. His
career is well known. Therefore I can limit myself to stating that
we worked together as vice consuls in London, as legation counsellors
in the Foreign Office and later, after Herr Von Neurath became
Minister in 1932, until my resignation in 1935. In the meantime
Von Neurath was in Copenhagen, Rome, London, and for some time
at his home, and finally in Prague. We met only occasionally when
I was in Berlin, and we kept up a comparatively lively correspondence
with each other as old friends. I myself was employed in the
Foreign Office during the entire period. From 1921 on I was
director of the Legal Department, and from 1923 I was director of
the political, so-called Western Department, which I directed until
I left the service. I voluntarily tendered my resignation at the end
of 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What do you know about the attitude,
the fundamental attitude of Herr Von Neurath on domestic
and foreign policy, but only on broad lines?
<span class='pageno' title='108' id='Page_108'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: In domestic politics, Herr Von Neurath stood close to
the conservative circles but he was never a member of the Conservative
Party. From this basic conservative attitude and also because
of his outstanding character traits of loyalty to duty and reliability,
he had the confidence of Reich President Von Hindenburg, and
retained it without interruption until the latter’s death. Herr Von
Hindenburg esteemed Von Neurath as a prudent, moderate, reliable
diplomat. Men of other party inclinations also had confidence in
Von Neurath. I shall mention only the deceased Reich President,
Ebert, who recalled Neurath to office during his term.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What do you know about Von
Neurath’s appointment as Reich Foreign Minister in the summer
of 1932?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: The appointment of Herr Von Neurath as Reich
Foreign Minister was based on a personal wish of President Von
Hindenburg. Neurath did not become Foreign Minister within the
Von Papen Cabinet, but became Foreign Minister as the special
confidant of President Von Hindenburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Then how did it happen that Von
Neurath remained Foreign Minister in the new Hitler Government
also?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: Von Neurath did not participate so far as I know in
the negotiations with Hitler about the assumption of power. If I
can rely only on my memory, he was sick abed with a heart disease
during the decisive days, but he remained Foreign Minister, again
at the special wish of Von Hindenburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Can you tell us anything about the
attitude, the relationship of Neurath to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: I should like to remark by way of introduction that I
cannot testify on this subject from my own immediate observation.
I was never present at conferences which Herr Von Neurath held
with Hitler. I myself never had any official conversation with Hitler
whatsoever. But, according to Neurath’s own description, and
according to the information which I received from other important
personalities in the course of time, I had the impression that,
especially in the first years, Hitler treated Herr Von Neurath carefully
and politely. To what extent this was out of respect for the
Reich President, whose regard for Von Neurath was, of course,
known to Hitler, I cannot say. In any case, Neurath was never
actually in the confidence of Hitler and was not in the small circle
close to Hitler, the powerful men of the Party. After the death of
President Von Hindenburg, Von Neurath remained because he
had promised the Reich President to do so. During the following
<span class='pageno' title='109' id='Page_109'></span>
period also, Neurath repeatedly attempted to exercise his moderating
and calming influence on the Party. However, I know that as
disappointments and differences of opinion multiplied, Herr Von
Neurath tried many times to separate from Hitler. In this connection
I can recall two occasions on which he offered his resignation,
and one of these appeals he showed me. It was in writing and must
have been dated from the beginning of the year 1936. For at that
time I had already resigned and visited Herr Von Neurath as a
friend in a purely private capacity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now can you also give us a brief
picture of Neurath’s attitude toward the National Socialist Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: At first Herr Von Neurath adopted an attitude of
reserve toward the Party and in particular its leading men. To
my knowledge he was personally acquainted with hardly any of
these men, since, indeed, he had lived most of the time abroad.
Neurath was convinced that by reason of his years of experience as
an old diplomat and supported by his confidential position with the
Reich President, and the latter’s moderating influence, he would
succeed in working in accordance with his policy, which was
directed toward compromise and understanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before me, and I believe also before his other colleagues, Neurath
frequently referred to experiences of this sort which he had
had with Fascism in Rome. He occasionally said that such revolutionary
elements should just be allowed to develop and that these
hotheads would come to their senses if they were given time and
opportunity to gather experience themselves in responsible positions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the way, Neurath also shared the opinions of State Secretary
Von Bülow in this respect. He retained this State Secretary of
Reich Chancellor Brüning, and also protected him until his death
against repeated attempts of the Party to get rid of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, I should like to mention a small detail which was
very valuable to us in the office at the time. When State Secretary
Von Bülow, who was generally popular, died suddenly, Neurath
managed to get Hitler to attend the funeral at the Kaiser Wilhelm
Memorial Church. The old officials of the Foreign Office saw in that
a gratifying and reassuring sign for the strong position of our
Minister in relation to the Party. This event, which in itself is perhaps
unimportant, happened exactly 10 years ago today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: As head of the Political Department
of the Foreign Office, you were one of Neurath’s foremost co-workers,
and can surely tell us what was the dominant tendency
of Neurath’s foreign policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: Neurath’s political attitude on the whole was, in accordance
with his whole character and his years of experience in politics,
<span class='pageno' title='110' id='Page_110'></span>
inclined toward compromise, waiting, negotiation. Measures backed
up by ultimatums and attempts at solution by violence did not suit
Von Neurath’s temperament. Neurath was neither a gambler nor
a fighter by nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now I come to individual important
foreign political events which occurred during the period in
which you worked under Herr Von Neurath and were head of the
political section.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In October 1933 Germany left the Disarmament Conference and
the League of Nations. Now, I should like to ask you whether this
step of Germany’s, leaving the Conference and the League of
Nations, was based on any aggressive or belligerent tendencies for
the moment or for the future?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: No. As far as the picture of the events mentioned by
defendant’s counsel was clear to us, the experts, it was as follows:
No one of us in the Foreign Office thought of warlike plans or
preparations for war. It was only done to proclaim as impressively
as possible that Germany would no longer allow herself to be considered
a nation without the same rights and obligations as other
peoples.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same way the militarization of the Rhineland was not
based on any aggressive intention, either for the moment or for
the future.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In the next few years, in 1935,
Germany’s military sovereignty was reintroduced, and a year later,
the demilitarized Rhineland zone was remilitarized. I should like to
read you one sentence from the affidavit of the former minister and
interpreter Paul Schmidt of the Foreign Office. He says the following
with regard to the events in the spring of 1935:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The conclusion of a pact of mutual assistance between France
and Russia on 2 May 1935 followed the proclamation of the
establishment of a German Air Force and the introduction
of general compulsory military service in March 1935.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Will you please give us a brief review of the historical development
of these matters which led to the reintroduction of military
sovereignty in 1935 and to the remilitarization of the Rhineland
in March 1936?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: I believe...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, we have had the
historical development of these matters over and over again. Surely
we do not want it from this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Only very briefly, only the dates,
in proper order, Mr. President; no explanations about it. I should
<span class='pageno' title='111' id='Page_111'></span>
only like to emphasize strongly once more how the individual
events are connected with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal have the dates in their minds.
We really have had these dates in our minds for some months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Very well. If the Court believes
that it does not need to be informed about it, I must, of course,
dispense with it. Then I come to a last...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you can put any question you really
want to put about it, but you said, “Will you give us the historical
developments from the 2d of May 1935?” We have heard that over
and over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, Mr. President. I was interested
only in the following: From this affidavit of Herr Schmidt
which I have just quoted, one could directly follow...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Ask the question, whatever you want to ask
about this affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Then I shall formulate the question
as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] I have just read this sentence by
Herr Schmidt, and I have also told you what can be read from
it; namely, that the conclusion of the Franco-Russian Pact of
2 May 1935 was the result of the restoration of military sovereignty.
Is that true or what was the case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: That question is difficult to answer if one merely
considers these two events in chronological order. The conclusion
of the Franco-Russian Pact was on 2 May 1935; the restoration of
military sovereignty was already in March 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the negotiations for this treaty of assistance go back
much farther, and I should like to recall the fact that the critical
stage, into which these negotiations had entered before the restoration
of military sovereignty, is shown very clearly in the report
of the French Military Committee’s reporter in which the latter
speaks quite openly of a close entente between the two nations.
That was on 23 November 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now I come to another question
and should like to ask you whether you know the opinions and
attitude of Von Neurath concerning the Austrian question, at least
during your time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: I have known Herr Von Neurath’s attitude toward the
Austrian question for a much longer time than the period when we
worked together during his term as Minister, for as a southern
German he was always particularly interested in the problem and
<span class='pageno' title='112' id='Page_112'></span>
I recall many conversations which I had with him even when I
was still a vice consul. His attitude and intentions had always
been to make the relations between Germany and Austria closer
in the economic sphere, chiefly in the interests of Austria, and
politically to guarantee a similar policy by treaties, but otherwise
not to encroach on Austria’s independence; that is what we in the
Foreign Office had already learned several years before he became
Minister, from our experience with the customs union, which at
that time was actually intended only in an economic sense. The fact
that this attempt was quite generally considered as a political
union gave pause for thought and should have warned everyone
who had resolved to touch this hot iron again. Therefore, Neurath,
during his period of office, whenever he discussed the problem with
me and worked on it, thought along just these lines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to add here that the critical time on the Austrian
question was probably after I left office. Moreover, even Hitler
originally shared Neurath’s moderate conception, as was shown
in his conversation with Mussolini in Venice in the summer of 1934.
Especially interesting, however, are the remarks which Hitler made
on the Anschluss problem to Sir John Simon during the negotiations
in Berlin in March 1935. At that time Hitler expressed himself to
the English statesman about that as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the people in London knew Austria as well as he did, they
would believe his assurance that he could not want to increase our
economic troubles by adding another field of economic difficulties.
Germany did not want to interfere in this country at all. He was
perfectly aware that any interference in Austrian affairs, even if
it meant carrying out the wish of the Austrian people themselves
for an Anschluss, could not be legalized. That was Hitler’s opinion
at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neurath also rejected all interference in Austrian internal
affairs and strongly condemned the attempts which could be noticed
in Party circles to give direct support to the Austrian National
Socialists. During my time Neurath did everything he could to
keep the Foreign Office out of the internal political struggle in
Austria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Still one more question. Up to the
time of your resignation at the beginning of 1936, was there ever
any talk in the Foreign Office of attacking Czechoslovakia or not
observing existent treaties with Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: Never, neither the one nor the other. Our economic
and political relations with Czechoslovakia were, as long as I was
in office, very good. We had no occasion whatsoever to change them,
not even the slightest.
<span class='pageno' title='113' id='Page_113'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And now my last question. Can
you tell us anything about Herr Von Neurath’s attitude toward
the race question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KÖPKE: On this question Neurath was completely opposed to
the Party attitude. In this connection I should like to recall an
experience which Neurath told me personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Jewish legislation was about to be proclaimed the
Reich Minister of Justice Gürtner came to him in great excitement
and told Von Neurath that he, Gürtner, had warned Hitler in vain
against proclaiming these quite impossible laws. He strongly urged
Herr Von Neurath as Foreign Minister to point out the enormous
dangers which this madness could set loose abroad. Neurath told
me that he did this immediately, but that all his efforts had been
in vain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Neurath’s personal attitude on the Jewish problem was
thoroughly conciliatory and reasonable, in keeping with his
generally kind personality and his religious attitude. Among many
examples I should like to refer here to only one, which is the
following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the time when we were in London together, the Jewish
doctor at the Embassy was also one of the closest friends of the
Neurath family. When he had to leave London during the World
War and was homeless and without employment, Neurath immediately
took active steps to help his old friend.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Reich Foreign Minister also, Von Neurath always helped
non-Aryan colleagues, although that brought him often under attack
from the Party circles and was not always easy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I have no further
questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any other member of the defendants’
counsel want to ask any question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do the Prosecution wish to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the Tribunal will, of
course, not consider that the Prosecution are accepting every statement
of the witness; but I do not think that it would be a useful
appropriation of time to cross-examine him. Therefore, I shall ask
no questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment, Sir David. Sir David, would
it be convenient to you and to the members of the defendants’
counsel to discuss the questions of supplementary applications for
witnesses and documents at 2 o’clock?
<span class='pageno' title='114' id='Page_114'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Certainly, My Lord, it would
be very convenient to me. I do not think there are many serious
matters about which there will be serious dispute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I thought there were not. Very well, we
will do that then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, call your next witness and then we can
have him sworn before the adjournment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: May I ask that Dr. Dieckhoff be
allowed to follow Dr. Köpke?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Dieckhoff took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HANS HEINRICH DIECKHOFF (Witness): Hans Heinrich
Dieckhoff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now the Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='115' id='Page_115'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please, My
Lord, the first application is on behalf of the Defendant Von Neurath
with regard to M. François-Poncet. That has been dealt with; that
is covered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, My Lord, the next is an application from Dr. Marx on
behalf of the Defendant Streicher to put in an affidavit by the
publisher, Herr Gassner of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. My Lord, the publisher is
intended to deal with the question of the rise and the circulation of
Der Stürmer during the years 1933 to 1935. The Prosecution have
already submitted to the Tribunal that they did not think that that
was relevant when an application was made to call Herr Gassner as a
witness. The Prosecution still take the same position. My Lord, it
is for an affidavit, and we leave to the Tribunal as to whether they
would like the affidavit, but the Prosecution fail to see the relevance
of that evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would Dr. Marx like to say something about
that now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANNS MARX (Counsel for Defendant Streicher): Mr. President,
I have just discussed this matter with Defendant Streicher;
and he tells me that the witness, Herr Gassner, whom I have proposed
to call and from whom an affidavit had been proposed, would
only be in a position to speak about the publication figures of Der
Stürmer from the year 1941 onwards. That, of course, is of no
interest whatever to the defense. I shall, therefore, forego the
affidavit and rely on what the witness Hiemer has said in that
respect. Therefore, it will not be necessary at all to procure the
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the next application is
by Dr. Kranzbühler on behalf of the Defendant Dönitz for further
consideration and admission of the affidavit of the former fleet
judge, Jäckel, by reason of the course of the cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I think the most convenient course would be if the
Prosecution do not object to the application at this time but reserve
the right, when Dr. Kranzbühler makes the use that he desires of
the affidavit, to consider whether we shall then object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is really evidence in rebuttal, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, in rebuttal of the points
raised in the cross-examination. It is very difficult to decide whether
one should make a final objection until one knows what use
Dr. Kranzbühler is going to make of it. I suggest that we do not
object at this stage.
<span class='pageno' title='116' id='Page_116'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, these applications and the Tribunal’s
orders granting the witnesses are always subject to that provision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please, then
the Prosecution makes no further objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then there are two applications on behalf of the
Defendant Von Neurath, a request for minutes from the interrogatory
of the...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: They have both been withdrawn, have they
not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Oh, they have? I was not certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, then Dr. Thoma makes application on behalf of the
Defendant Rosenberg for three matters: The exchange of letters
between Dr. Ley and the defendant; the entry of Dr. Strauber
27 May 1944; and third, a note of the Ministerialrat, Dr. Beil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the Prosecution feel that these documents are cumulative,
and they leave it to the Tribunal with that suggestion—that the
case is already well covered. I do not know if Dr. Thoma wishes to
say anything further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED THOMA (Counsel for Defendant Rosenberg): Gentlemen
of the Tribunal, I should like to refer to it quite briefly, as
apparently there is an error in the matter of Dr. Beil. It is a
question here of the interrogatory. I have sent to Beil an interrogatory
which has not yet been returned. Otherwise, there is nothing
that I know about this matter; but I have made an application which
has not been mentioned yet. I applied for some of Rosenberg’s
writings, <span class='it'>Tradition und Gegenwart</span>, new speeches and translations,
to be included in the document book, for these deal with questions
which were discussed on the occasion of Gau educational meetings
and discussions and which also deal with such questions as the
peaceful living together of the nations of Europe, religious tolerance,
his advocacy of an ideal humanity, and similar writings. I request
that these articles be admitted. Apart from that, I have no further
applications to make; and for the rest I leave the decision, of course,
to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If I understand what you said aright,
Dr. Thoma, you were not referring to any of the applications which
are before us. The applications which are before us are an exchange
of letters between Dr. Ley and the defendant in the autumn of 1944;
another is an entry which Dr. Strauber made; and the third is a
note of Dr. Beil; you have not referred to them, have you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Yes, that is right. I have to confess that these
applications are completely new to me. These applications must
have been made by Rosenberg on his own initiative, because I
<span class='pageno' title='117' id='Page_117'></span>
cannot find any trace of them. Or perhaps an error was made in
the memorandum to the Tribunal. I do not know the applications.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Thoma, the copies of the applications
are before us, and they appear to be signed both by the
Defendant Rosenberg and by yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: In that case, this must have happened months ago.
I cannot remember; this is from 3 June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: At any rate, you do not want them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Application Number 3 is settled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have re-read the applications just now, and I do remember
them. I ask you to make a decision favorable to the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the next applications
are for a number of documents on behalf of the Defendant
Von Papen, and the Prosecution have no objection to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, a good many of them—certainly
Numbers 3, 5, and 13—have either been admitted or rejected, I think.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: That is so, My Lord. I had a note
opposite 13. I really think they have been dealt with, My Lord; they
are in the books, and I do not think any further discussion is required.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are they all in the book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I think so, My Lord. I do not
know if—Dr. Kubuschok says he agrees with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please, the next
is an application on behalf of the Defendant Bormann, a request for
a decree of Hitler’s and a decree issued by Bormann in 1944. My
Lord, the Prosecution have no objection to these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not quite understand the meaning of the
last one. Can you tell me what it means?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I took it myself that
it was “to” the SD, instead of “of” the SD—the appertaining of
members of the head office of the National Socialist Party of the SD.
I am afraid that that guess on my part does not meet with approval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRIEDRICH BERGOLD (Counsel for Defendant Bormann):
My Lord, this concerns a decree from Bormann in which he prohibits
members of the Party Chancellery belonging to the SD. It is a
decree of Bormann’s applying to the Party Chancellery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the remaining applications
are on behalf of the Defendant Göring, the admission of an
affidavit by Baron von Gersdorff, and a book by Joseph Chapski.
<span class='pageno' title='118' id='Page_118'></span>
My Lord, my Soviet colleague has dealt with that by submission in
writing, dated 20 June. I did not propose to say anything further
about that, My Lord. Colonel Pokrovsky is here if Your Lordship
would like to hear him further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought we had already made an order with
reference to this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Your Lordship has.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We made the order on 9 June, apparently,
that for the Defendant Göring three witnesses could be produced
either personally...</p>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps we had better hear from Dr. Stahmer about this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO STAHMER (Counsel for Defendant Göring): Mr. President,
that is the way I understood the decision of the Tribunal.
I had applied for five witnesses. The Tribunal ordered that I could
produce only three out of the five witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then with reference to the affidavit nothing
was said, as far as I can remember, in that particular decision, so
that I had assumed that I would be free to ask for admission of
affidavits insofar as the Tribunal considers them necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, after the Tribunal had made
that order about limiting the number of witnesses to three, did you
not receive a communication, to which you have replied, I think,
suggesting that possibly you might be able to dispense with actual
oral witnesses and do that whole part of the case by affidavits?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Mr. President, I received that communication;
and I have already negotiated about the matter with the
Russian Prosecution. We did not quite reach an agreement, however;
and therefore I made a written application to the Tribunal a few
days ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but was not the agreement which you
were trying to arrive at an agreement that only three affidavits
should be produced on either side? Or was it more than three?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No. The question which remains and which we
have not agreed upon is whether I will be given the opportunity to
read a few of the affidavits here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see. Dr. Stahmer, I think the position is,
then, that unless you are able to arrive at an agreement with the
Soviet Prosecution, we shall have to abide by our previous order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You will make further efforts to achieve an
agreement with the Soviet Prosecution and let the Tribunal know.
<span class='pageno' title='119' id='Page_119'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I wonder if your Lordship will
grant me the indulgence of mentioning three exhibits. They all refer
to the diary of Admiral Assmann, My Lord, which was introduced
during the cases of the Defendants Dönitz and Raeder. There are
three exhibits concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first is Document D-879. We thought that would be more
complete if a connecting page was put in to make the continuity of
the exhibit. For that purpose, My Lord, the Prosecution asks that
Exhibit GB-482 be withdrawn and that there be submitted the two
pages which were originally in it with a connecting page. That is
merely adding a connecting page, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second is Document D-881...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any objection to that on the part of
the Defense?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I do not think so, My Lord; I
have not heard of any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do the documents relate to, did you say?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The diary of Admiral Assmann,
who was on the staff of the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, it is only a question of
putting the exhibit in proper form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second document, My Lord, is D-881, which is another
passage from the same diary, on 23 February 1940. I promised Your
Lordship that I should put in an exhibit when I dealt with the diary
in cross-examination; and, My Lord, the exhibit has been prepared,
and I want to put it in under the Number GB-475. That is, Document
D-881 will become Exhibit GB-475.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third, which is in the same position as the second, is Document
D-892. That exhibit has now been prepared and will become
Exhibit GB-476. Copies are available for the defendants and will be
given to them after the approval of the Court is given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And copies, of course, will be supplied to the
Court as well?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Of course, My Lord. They are
just awaiting the formal approval of the Court, and they will be
submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Sir David, that is all right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Sir David, we will consider the other matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please.
<span class='pageno' title='120' id='Page_120'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT; Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Dr. Thoma.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Mr. President, I just wanted to use this opportunity
to submit to the Tribunal the affidavit of Robert Scholz, the Chief
of Special Staff Rosenberg. It has been translated into English and
French, and I should now like to submit it under Exhibit Number 41
to the Tribunal. I have already shown it to Mr. Dodd, and he has
not objected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DR. HERBERT KRAUS (Counsel for Defendant
Schacht): Mr. President, I wanted to ascertain whether and up to
what date after this session we may submit affidavits and documents.
The reason is that during recent days I have received two affidavits
and a document, the relevance of which we have not yet definitely
decided upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David, the Tribunal would like to know
when the Counsel for the Prosecution and Counsel for the Defense
think would be the best time to deal with these matters which are
outstanding and with any evidence which either the Defense or the
Prosecution may wish to bring in rebuttal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, I have not had
the chance of discussing it with any of the Counsel for the Defense;
but I should have thought at the end of the evidence. One might
reasonably hope that the evidence will finish this week. It might be
possible to deal with it on Saturday morning or on Monday, and
suit the Counsel for the Defense, and, of course, as the Tribunal
decides.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. The Tribunal, I think, will expect the
Defense Counsel and the Prosecution to be ready, directly when the
end of the evidence comes, to deal with all these additional questions
which are outstanding and also with any applications that they may
have with reference to rebuttal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I wanted that to be clearly understood, that
it will be expected that it is to be done immediately the evidence
closes. That, I think, answers Dr. Kraus’ point about the affidavits
and documents. That would be the most appropriate time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sir David, have you got any ideas as to how long that would
take?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I think a very short
time. I should have thought that 2 days or thereabouts would see
it through. I have discussed it with Mr. Dodd, and that was the
view we took.
<span class='pageno' title='121' id='Page_121'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. In about 2 days at the outside?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: At the outside, My Lord, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Dieckhoff resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Witness, since what date do you
know Herr Von Neurath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: Since 1913; I met him when I joined the Foreign
Office. He was legation counsellor in the Foreign Office at that time.
I then met him again in Constantinople, and there I had contact with
him. Then I did not meet him again until 1930.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In what capacity did you have
dealings with Herr Von Neurath beginning with 1930?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: Herr Von Neurath was then, from 1930 till 1932,
Ambassador to London; and I was head of the Department “England-America”
in the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: How was the co-operation during
that time between the Foreign Office—that is, yourself—and Herr
Von Neurath, who was then Ambassador to London?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: The co-operation was excellent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about Herr
Von Neurath’s appointment to the position of Reich Foreign Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I remember that most of the leading officials of
the Foreign Office were greatly upset by the sudden departure of
Brüning, whose steady and moderate policy we approved at the
time. We submitted to the change in the person of the Foreign
Minister only because Neurath replaced Brüning and we knew that
Herr Von Neurath was a man of high standards and an experienced
diplomat. Furthermore, we knew that he had represented Brüning’s
policy in London; and we expected that as Foreign Minister he
would continue Brüning’s policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I welcomed Herr Von Neurath, I think it was on 2 June, at the
station in Berlin when he arrived in Germany. From conversations
with him I gathered the impression that he very much disliked to
leave London and to take over the Foreign Ministry. But he said to
me, “I do not think I shall be able to refuse the wish of the old
gentleman.” That, of course, was Reich President Von Hindenburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What position did you hold yourself
during the time when you worked under Herr Von Neurath in the
Foreign Ministry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: At first, I remained at the head of the England-America
Department until 1936. Afterward, in April 1936, I took
<span class='pageno' title='122' id='Page_122'></span>
over the re-established political department. In June State Secretary
Von Bülow died, and in August 1936 I was appointed acting State
Secretary in the Foreign Office. I remained in that provisional
position until March 1937, and then I became Ambassador to
Washington.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did Herr Von Neurath, as Foreign
Minister, retain the old officials of the Foreign Office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: He retained the old officials in practically all the
leading positions of both the domestic and the foreign service. The
State Secretary Von Bülow for instance remained for 4 years, until
his death, in the same position in the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He sent Ambassador Von Hoesch to London as his successor, and
he sent Ambassador Von Hassell to Rome, and Ambassador Köster
to Paris—all of these were old diplomatic officials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Can you tell us from your own
experience during your activities what the aims of Neurath’s foreign
policy were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: It was the aim of Herr Von Neurath to maintain
good relations with all states and thereby to re-establish gradually
Germany’s status of equal rights which we had lost in 1919. This
was the same policy that had been pursued by Stresemann and
Brüning. Herr Von Neurath was aware of the difficulties of Germany’s
position. He talked to me about it repeatedly. He was under
no misapprehension about it. He saw things realistically. His tendency
was to exercise moderation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What do you know about Herr
Von Neurath’s entry into Hitler’s Government, which was formed on
30 January 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I know about this only what I was told by State
Secretary Von Bülow when I returned to Berlin from leave at the
beginning of February 1933. According to this, Herr Von Neurath
had no part in the formation of the new Cabinet, that is, Hitler’s
Cabinet. Apart from that, he was sick during that time. He heard
of the plan of making Hitler Reich Chancellor and of forming a new
government. He wanted to discuss it with Reich President Von Hindenburg
in order to obtain certain reservations for himself; but he
came too late and could not obtain these reservations. In spite of
this, he retained the Foreign Ministry in the new Cabinet because
he did not want to refuse the wish of the Reich President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about Herr
Von Neurath’s attitude toward the National Socialist domestic
policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I know that Herr Von Neurath, soon after 30 January
1933 viewed the domestic policy with some anxiety, chiefly
<span class='pageno' title='123' id='Page_123'></span>
because he felt that it strongly affected our foreign policy. When,
in June 1933, I visited him in London, where he attended a conference
as head of the German delegation, he told me about his
anxieties; but he thought that these things would die down and that
developments would be similar to those in Fascist Italy, where
things had been very wild in the beginning, but had settled down
afterward. He was hoping that the same would happen in Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I am coming now to the year 1936.
One of the principal questions which dominated that year was the
Austrian problem. Can you tell us what Herr Von Neurath’s attitude
was toward the repeated interferences of German circles in the
internal affairs of Austria?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: Yes. Herr Von Neurath considered such German
interference in the internal affairs of Austria not only inadmissible
but damaging. He told me so repeatedly. He was striving for an
improvement of the economic relations with Austria and thereby
trying to improve gradually the political relations also. He wanted
to leave the sovereignty of Austria untouched. This was also the
aim of the agreement of 11 July 1936 between Germany and Austria,
that is, the economic strengthening of Austria and thereby the re-establishment
of good political relations between the two countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did you hear anything before
March of 1938 that Hitler had the intention to incorporate Austria
into Germany, if necessary, with force?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did you ever hear anything before
1938 that Hitler had intended to solve the Sudeten problem by force
or even to attack Czechoslovakia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know whether Hitler was
in full agreement until November 1937 with the peaceful policy
which Herr Von Neurath pursued with regard to both Austria and
Czechoslovakia and also with regard to the other European countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: Until Herr Von Neurath’s resignation in February
1938, I always presumed that Hitler agreed with the peaceful policy
pursued by Herr Von Neurath; and I never heard or learned
anything to the contrary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know what the thoughts,
the considerations of Herr Von Neurath in 1935 were regarding the
question of rearmament, that is to say, the re-establishment of Germany’s
military sovereignty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I know that Herr Von Neurath held the view that
Germany, by the declaration of the Western Powers on 11 December
<span class='pageno' title='124' id='Page_124'></span>
1932, had been granted equality of rights; and he considered her to
have the indisputable right to rearm after all disarmament efforts
had failed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I should like to put the same question
to you, with regard to the considerations and attitude of Herr
Von Neurath, with reference to the remilitarization of the demilitarized
Rhineland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I know that Herr Von Neurath was aware of the
seriousness of this problem, for he knew that the problem of the
remilitarization of the Rhineland was interconnected with the
Locarno Pact; but I know that he saw a breach of the Locarno Pact
in the Franco-Russian Agreement of Mutual Assistance concluded in
May 1935 and that as a result of the ratification of this pact, or its
going into effect, he firmly believed that Germany had the right to
re-establish military sovereignty in the Rhineland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was the general political
situation in those days? Taking it into consideration, was it not
justified to assume that sooner or later a peaceful solution of this
Rhineland problem would be arrived at in any case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: At any rate, the actual development after 7 March
1936 showed that the Western Powers, though they did not agree
to the remilitarization of the Rhineland, nevertheless very quickly
acquiesced in the <span class='it'>fait accompli</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I was at that time, during the second half of March 1936, for
2 weeks in London on behalf of the Reich Government; and I had
the opportunity to discuss this matter with many Englishmen; and
the view I found in the widest circles was that as Germany had
been granted equality of rights one could not deny her the right to
remilitarize the Rhineland. In some circles I even found the view
that it was a relief that the remilitarization of the Rhineland, which
was due sooner or later in any case, was carried out so quickly and
comparatively painlessly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: And now one last question. What
do you know about Herr Von Neurath’s resignation from the
position of Reich Foreign Minister in February 1938?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: I was Ambassador to Washington at that time and
I was completely surprised by Foreign Minister Von Neurath’s
sudden departure. I did know that there were many things he did
not agree with and that he had asked several times to be allowed
to resign. I also knew that he was ill; he suffered from a neurotic
heart. I also knew that he had passed his sixty-fifth birthday, which
gave him the right to retire. But I was surprised all the same, particularly
as I did not know the details at that time. I regretted
the resignation of the Foreign Minister, in whose peace policy I
<span class='pageno' title='125' id='Page_125'></span>
had confidence, very much. I remember that the official circles in
Washington also regretted the departure of Herr Von Neurath very
much, for Under Secretary of State Sumner Welles approached me
a few days after this event and told me that the American Government
regretted the departure of this man who had pursued a
moderate policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I have no further
questions to this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any other members of the defendants’
counsel wish to ask him any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: One single question, Witness. You said that
if Von Neurath assumed the office of Foreign Minister, you had
expected that he would continue Stresemann’s and Brüning’s policy.
According to your knowledge did he actually continue this policy of
Brüning’s after he became Foreign Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DIECKHOFF: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, on the same basis I
intimated with regard to the last witness, the Prosecution do not
desire to take up time by asking any questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness may retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, may I then have
your permission to call my third and last witness, Dr. Völkers, into
the witness stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Völkers took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HANS HERMANN VÖLKERS (Witness): Hans Hermann Völkers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Witness, you were twice the
personal adviser to Herr Von Neurath; first in his position as
Foreign Minister and later in his position as Reich Protector of
Bohemia and Moravia; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Yes; since 1920 I was a member of the Foreign
Office, and I spent all my time abroad. Under Stresemann I spent
4 years in Geneva as Consul General and as the permanent German
representative to the League of Nations; and in 1932 I was called
to the Foreign Office and became personal adviser to the newly,
<span class='pageno' title='126' id='Page_126'></span>
appointed Foreign Minister, Herr Von Neurath. I remained in that
position for a year; and then, upon my own request, I was sent to
Madrid as Embassy Counsellor, and later I became Minister to
Havana. In 1939 I was called back to the Foreign Office to act as
personal adviser with the title of chief of the office of Herr Von
Neurath, who in the meantime had been appointed Reich Protector
in Prague.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did this appointment as personal
adviser to Herr Von Neurath in Prague take place on the basis of
any personal relations or merely for professional reasons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Only for professional reasons. Until I was his
attaché in Berlin I did not know Herr Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was the attitude of the officials
of the Foreign Ministry toward Herr Von Neurath’s appointment
as Foreign Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: I had the impression that the officials of the Foreign
Office were generally most satisfied that in view of the difficult
internal political situation an old professional diplomat and expert
minister took over the direction of the Foreign Ministry, because
they saw in that a guarantee for a steady foreign political course;
all the more so as it was known that Herr Von Neurath had the
special confidence of Reich President Von Hindenburg and because
he enjoyed, due to his entire personality and his equanimity, the
special recognition and veneration of all the officials of the Foreign
Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Hitler came to power I had the impression that he was
skeptical and reserved toward him. He did not belong to the circle
of the closer associates of Hitler, and during the time I was with
him he never attended these evening conferences which Hitler held
in the Reich Chancellery in those days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Gradually, however, the pressure on the Foreign Office increased
more and more. The Auslands-Organisation was created and the
office of Ribbentrop started a competitive enterprise into which
were called all sorts of people who had been abroad. They made
all sorts of reports which went directly to the Führer without being
controlled by the Foreign Office. And then later on the head of
the Auslands-Organisation was installed as commissioner in the
Foreign Office while Prince Waldeck was transferred into the
personnel department of the Foreign Office. At that stage the
pressure became so strong that finally one could not fight against
it any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the fact that the Foreign Office had isolated itself for so
long and that it was still evading the pressure of the Party, that, I
think, is certainly the merit of the then Foreign Minister and his
<span class='pageno' title='127' id='Page_127'></span>
State Secretary Von Bülow. When the Jewish laws were then introduced
into the Foreign Office, too, I know that Herr Von Neurath
protected, as far as that was possible, his officials. I was in Stockholm
during the last 2 years of the war and met there two former
colleagues of mine with whom I am close friends. One is Ministerial
Director Richard Meier who used to be in charge of the Eastern
department and who had to leave quite soon and who often told me
in Stockholm how grateful he was to Herr Von Neurath for not
only having enabled him to take with him his family and his furniture
and everything when he went abroad but also that Herr Von
Neurath, until the collapse, continued to pay him his monthly
pensions in Swedish kroner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was your position and your
activity in Prague in the Government of the Protectorate?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: My position in Prague with the Government of the
Protectorate was approximately the same as the one I had 7 years
earlier when I had been personal adviser to the Foreign Minister
in the Foreign Office in Berlin, with the exception that in the
Foreign Office there is a special protocol department and a chief of
protocol, whereas in Prague I was also in charge of all protocols and
ceremonial affairs, and that was really my chief occupation. I was
head of the so-called Office of the Reich Protector, not to be confused
with the principal authority, with which I had nothing to do.
When I came to Prague in the summer of 1939 the office already
had been functioning for several months. My predecessor was one
Legation Counsellor Von Kessel from the Foreign Office. Apart
from myself two other officials from the Foreign Office, who were
subordinated to me, belonged to the Office of the Reich Protector,
also one Count Waldburg, whose mother was a Czech and who was
engaged by the Reich Protector because he was hoping to establish,
especially through him, good relations with the Czechs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The office was responsible, apart from the general and usual
routine matters, for dealing with the private correspondence and
the handling of personal petitions. In the course of time we had to
set up a special department, because later on, when the many
arrests took place, we received so many petitions, most of which
were addressed to the Reich Protector personally...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, surely this is very
remote from anything we have got to consider, and all the previous
evidence this witness has given has been cumulative evidence which
has not been cross-examined upon before; and now what he is
saying is all very remote to anything we have to consider.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: In fact, I have already come to an
end, Mr. President. I merely wanted to show that he is in a position
to answer the following questions from his own knowledge.
<span class='pageno' title='128' id='Page_128'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] What can you tell us from your own
observations and experiences about the attitude of Herr Von Neurath
toward the Czechs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: I can give you only general impressions. As I have
already told you, I had nothing to do with the actual activities of
the office but was attached to Herr Von Neurath personally only
for his private affairs and all ceremonial matters. But I do know,
and he told me, that when he took over his position as Reich Protector,
he did so with the intention of treating the Czech population
as justly and decently as possible in order to create, by smoothing
out the differences, a healthy basis for a peaceful living, side by
side, of the two nations. He told me frequently that he was
appointed Reich Protector, that is, protector of the Czechs; and we
knew that the last German Ambassador in Prague, Dr. Eisenlohr,
had often reported that the last Czechoslovakian Government, for
their part, had been prepared to effect an Anschluss with Germany.
He was an opponent of using military measures, and Herr Von
Neurath told me when I came to Prague—I think it was in September
1938—that he had expressed himself very strongly against
their use and that he together with Göring had visited Hitler in
Munich in order to dissuade him from that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my office I experienced again and again that Herr Von
Neurath—shall I go on—was very open-handed toward the Czechs
with regard to petitions. He had a lot of sympathy and understanding;
he examined each individual case, and that was very well
known among the Czechs. And as we in this office had the possibility
of submitting each single request and petition of Czech individuals
directly to the highest chief, the Czech petitioners very
frequently and gladly used this channel because the prospects for a
positive action on their private requests and petitions through the
highest local chief promised to be much more favorable than if they
were quickly processed by the authorities concerned in the Government.
Particularly this practice brought us in conflict with the
State Secretary...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, this witness is simply
making speeches, you know. You are not asking him any questions
at all. He is simply going on...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Witness, what do you know about
the personal and official relationship between Von Neurath and the
President of State Hacha?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: According to my observations, the personal and
official relationship between the Reich Protector and the President
of State Hacha was excellent; and I believe that this was not merely
a matter of form, but I had the impression that Herr Von Neurath
<span class='pageno' title='129' id='Page_129'></span>
really and sincerely liked the President of State because he considered
him a very decent and upright man who, under the existing
circumstances...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, when you see your counsel has
heard enough of your answer, surely you can stop...</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What was the relationship between
Herr Von Neurath and the State Secretary attached to him, Frank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: That was a very bad one. Herr Von Neurath told
me already at the time when I assumed my office that he had had
considerable difficulties with him because of his definite anti-Czech
attitude, as a Sudeten German—an attitude which a Reich German
could not easily understand. He had always hoped, however, that
Frank, who was not a civil servant but an outsider, would gradually
follow his policy and adapt himself to the civil service staff. But
unfortunately this was not possible. I do not know when...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Witness, can you describe to us
briefly what the actual official powers of Herr Von Neurath and
Frank were in relation to each other?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Herr Von Neurath was the superior of the State
Secretary. The State Secretary was in charge of the entire internal
administration, which was a very large one. Under State Secretary
Von Burgsdorff, who I think has been examined already before this
High Tribunal, worked under him. Besides being State Secretary,
Frank was also the Higher Police and SS Leader.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now, did Herr Von Neurath have
a certain influence on this part of Frank’s activities, that is to say,
in his capacity as Higher SS and Police Leader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: The way conditions were he had practically no influence.
I do not know whether in the beginning the matter had
already been legally settled. In practice, however, the Police and
the State Secretary were completely independent from Herr Von
Neurath regarding police measures. This had some connection with
the situation in the Reich, where Himmler, too, led the entire Police
and SS, having taken the police powers away from the Ministry of
the Interior. As far as I can remember, the matter was legally
settled in the autumn of 1939 to the effect that the Police was independent
and that Herr Von Neurath was to be informed afterward
of all measures taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: You mean by that the decree
regarding the organization of the administration and the German
Security Police in the Protectorate, under date of 1 September 1939?
<span class='pageno' title='130' id='Page_130'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Yes, I think that is the one. The first part referred
to the administration and the second part to the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, may I remind you
that the wording of this decree is contained in my document book
under Number Neurath-149.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It has been submitted as evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes. I merely wanted to remind
you that I have presented it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Was Herr Von Neurath at least informed
afterward, in accordance with the instructions, of the
police actions which Frank carried out independently?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: The Chief of the Police was an SS man by the name
of Böhme. He used to report to the Reich Protector several times
each week. I do not believe that he informed him in advance of
intended police actions. We never heard anything like that.
Whether he reported such actions afterward and in their entirety
is something which I cannot say. The rule was that the Reich Protector
sent to him, for comment, the various petitions from the next
of kin of Czechs who had been arrested and that Böhme would
bring them along when he came to report. That was generally the
way the Reich Protector was afterward informed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Well then, when Herr Von Neurath
was later on informed of such police measures, no matter in
which way, did he make attempts for the suspension of arrests or
for any limitation and mitigation of such police measures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: As I have already told you, we had set up in the
small office of the Reich Protector a special department for the
purpose of receiving such applications. This department, which of
course was directly under the jurisdiction of the Reich Protector,
did everything possible in order to reassure the next of kin and to
bring about the releases of the detained persons. The work was
particularly difficult because these local departments, the local
police chief and also State Secretary Frank, usually took a negative
attitude. Again and again the Reich Protector would then appeal
directly to Himmler and very often to the Führer himself. I know
and remember that there was a very excited correspondence with
Himmler and that Herr Von Neurath repeatedly complained to the
Führer about this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Witness, can you judge, or can you
tell us how far Herr Von Neurath, as Reich Protector, apart from
the Police and police measures, was free and independent in his
political and economic measures and orders, or how far he was
depending on Berlin when giving those?
<span class='pageno' title='131' id='Page_131'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: When I came to Prague there were all sorts of other
offices beside that of the Reich Protector. For instance, there was a
Reich Commissioner for Economy who, as far as I can remember
and as I heard at the time, had already begun to exercise his functions
when the Office of the Reich Protector had not yet been
established. Then there was a Plenipotentiary for the Four Year
Plan and there was the Armed Forces Plenipotentiary who had a
large staff. Even the Party agencies were not centrally organized.
Prague and the north belonged to the Sudetengau under Gauleiter
Henlein; the whole of Moravia belonged to the Niederdonau Gau,
under Gauleiter Dr. Jury; and the west belonged to a third Gau.
All these Gauleiter tried, in turn, on their part...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Counsel, this is all detail, is it not, and quite
unnecessary detail?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about Von
Neurath’s attitude toward numerous plans of germanizing the
Czechs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: No, I know nothing about that. I remember only
that, right at the beginning of the war, Herr Von Neurath told me
that the whole structure of the Protectorate was regarded by him
as a temporary solution and that the peace would have to decide
the ultimate fate of Czechoslovakia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Well, then, as you probably remember,
in the autumn of 1939 there were the first demonstrations in
Prague on the occasion of the Independence Day of Czechoslovakia,
on 28 October 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Well, I cannot remember the details. There were
demonstrations on a Czech national holiday in October. As far as I
can remember, they took place on the Wenzel Platz, and the
Národni-ulice. I, personally, did...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: What do you know about the consequences
of new demonstrations particularly on the part of the
students at Prague when a wounded student died and was buried
on 15 November? What do you know about these demonstrations
and what happened immediately in the wake of these demonstrations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Previous to the second demonstration, as far as I
remember, the instruction was given to exercise restraint. The
demonstrations were generally, as I was told later, not particularly
alarming. In spite of this, Frank had reported to Berlin about it.
At any rate, the Reich Protector and Frank and General Friderici
were called to Berlin for a conference with Hitler in the Reich
Chancellery. I accompanied the Reich Protector at the time. Chvalkovsky,
the Czech Minister in Berlin, was also invited. I was present
<span class='pageno' title='132' id='Page_132'></span>
when Hitler, in a very excited and rude manner, reproached the
Minister because of the events, for which he was holding the Czech
Government responsible. Whether the closing of universities was
discussed on that occasion, I cannot remember, nor can I remember
having heard him threaten the shooting or arrest of students. The
manner in which Hitler treated the Minister was most embarrassing
to us. The Minister then left the room without saying a single
further word. As far as I can remember, the subject was then
mentioned no further. We had lunch, and when saying goodby,
Hitler said to Frank that he wanted to talk with him some more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Neurath was not asked to stay and I remember that
while walking home with him he was very angry about it. On the
following day, I traveled back with Herr Von Neurath while Frank
had already left the same night for Prague. I remember that when
I came into the office in Prague, I saw a red poster declaring that
because of the demonstrations, the shooting of the leaders and the
arrest of students and the closing of universities had been ordered;
that poster carried Neurath’s signature. As I did not know what
had happened in Prague in the meantime, I was utterly surprised,
because I had heard nothing about these measures in Berlin; and I
suspected an intrigue on Frank’s part and went to report the matter
to Neurath. I had the impression that Herr Von Neurath was deeply
upset and just as unpleasantly surprised as I was and that he had
known nothing at all about this previously. Soon afterward Frank
passed through my room going into Neurath’s room, carrying that
red poster under his arm. I do not know whether Von Neurath had
sent for him or whether he came on his own initiative.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Did Herr Von Neurath afterwards,
at least after this unfortunate matter had occurred, use his influence
for the release of these students who had been arrested?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Yes. He immediately used his influence, but he did
not even succeed in getting hold of the list of names of the arrested
students. Only after urging the Czechs for a long time did we
receive from the Czech Government an incomplete list of names. In
spite of this, Herr Von Neurath immediately worked for their
release; and he did, in fact, have excellent results in that connection
as time went by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about what
was done to accommodate or employ those students who, on account
of these demonstrations and the subsequent closing of the universities,
had more or less become idle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: No, I know nothing about that, and I had nothing
to do with that matter.
<span class='pageno' title='133' id='Page_133'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: But do you know whether Herr
Von Neurath repeatedly urged Hitler to reopen the universities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Yes, I remember that the chancellor, named Rosny,
of the Czech University, whom I knew well, had asked me once for
that and I reported it to Herr Von Neurath and Herr Von Neurath
again made efforts at the time; but as far as I know, as long as we
were in Prague the universities were not reopened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you remember a Czech Fascist
organization, Vlayka? I do not know whether I pronounce the name
correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: Yes, I do, but I know very little about it. I only
know that we received in the office a number of pledges of loyalty
sent to us by members of the movement, and I also know that we
had been informed by Czech sources that these people were partly
criminal and generally not worth much. Herr Von Neurath adopted
quite generally the view that this was an internal affair of the
Czechs and that, after all, these were people who wanted to work
together with us. But he, on his part, refused any collaboration;
and such letters and pledges were never answered, I believe, by our
office. But I know...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Herr Von Neurath was also, besides
being Reich Protector, president of the Secret Cabinet Council.
Did you, since you partly handled his correspondence of a more
personal nature, notice anything indicating that Herr Von Neurath
became active in this capacity as president of the Secret Cabinet
Council?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: No. As long as I was in Prague, Herr Von Neurath
was never active. On the contrary, on one occasion he told me that
Hitler, when he appointed him, had told him that he should not
think that he would ever call a meeting of the Cabinet Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Herr Von Neurath was also a
member of the so-called Defense Council. Did he ever have anything
to do in this capacity in Prague?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: No, I did not know that he was a member of the
Defense Council. The fundamental decrees from Berlin concerning
the Protectorate were frequently signed by the Ministerial Council
for the Defense of the Reich—I believe that was the name—but
Neurath had never signed or countersigned them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Herr Von Neurath was appointed,
as is well known, an honorary Gruppenführer of the SS and later,
honorary Obergruppenführer of the SS. Did Herr Von Neurath at
that time, when he was in Prague, ever wear that uniform?
<span class='pageno' title='134' id='Page_134'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: As a rule, he wore his Reich Minister uniform. A
portrait was also once made of him in that uniform. He used to
wear civilian clothes a great deal. It may be that he once wore the
black uniform of the SS, on the occasion of a parade of the SS; but
I do not know for certain now. Otherwise, he never wore it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you know anything about the
circumstances and reasons concerning Herr Von Neurath’s departure
from Prague in September 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VÖLKERS: When Herr Von Neurath was ordered to come to
headquarters that September, he was accompanied by his military
adjutant. I met him at the airfield; and in the car he told me that
Hitler had been furious because of the acts of sabotage in the Protectorate
and wanted to send Heydrich to do some exemplary
punishing. He, Neurath, had stated that he did not want to have
anything to do with that and had asked for his release. Hitler then
had ordered that he should first of all go on leave, and so he did.
He departed on one of the following days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I have no further
questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, may I make one request at the end of my case.
I have not yet been able to submit all documents because I have
not yet received all the translations. May I reserve myself the right
to submit the few remaining documents, perhaps at the end of the
case of my colleague, Dr. Fritz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You need not wait for the translation. You
can offer the documents in evidence now. Put in a list with the
numbers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I have not got them
with me, I am afraid. Perhaps, if I may, I could do so tomorrow or
the day after when Dr. Fritz is finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do any of the defendants’ counsel want to ask any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, the Prosecution do not
wish to cross-examine, on the same basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, may I refer to one collection of documents that are in
our Document Book 12b, the collection of the anti-Jewish decrees in
the Protectorate. They are all from the <span class='it'>Verordnungsblatt</span> for the
Protectorate, and the Prosecution ask the Tribunal to take judicial
notice of them as being an official publication. The collection is
merely for convenience and access of the Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='135' id='Page_135'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then that closes your case for the present, Dr. Lüdinghausen.
The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I call on counsel for the Defendant Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HEINZ FRITZ (Counsel for Defendant Fritzsche): Mr. President,
I intend to present the case of the Defendant Fritzsche as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, I should like to call the Defendant Fritzsche to the witness
stand and then the witness Von Schirmeister. In the course of these
two examinations I intend to present to the Tribunal a few affidavits
and to refer to these and to the rest of the contents of my two
document books.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its decision of 8 March 1946 the Tribunal granted as witnesses
for my case: First, Herr Von Schirmeister, second Dr. Krieg; and
as documents: The text of all radio speeches of the Defendant
Fritzsche from 1932 to 1945 and the archives of Deutscher Schnelldienst
(fast official news service) of the Propaganda Ministry. Of
all the evidence, in spite of the efforts of the General Secretary,
unfortunately only the witness Von Schirmeister could be brought
here. Therefore, I had to rearrange my case and ask for the indulgence
of the Tribunal if I go into a somewhat greater detail than
originally intended in examining the Defendant Fritzsche and the
witness Von Schirmeister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the approval of the Tribunal I shall now call the Defendant
Fritzsche to the witness stand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Fritzsche took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>HANS FRITZSCHE (Defendant): Hans Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The defendant repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Herr Fritzsche, will you please describe briefly your
career up to the year 1933?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: As to that, may I refer to my affidavit, Document
3469-PS, Points 1 and 3 to 8? In addition I can limit myself now
to a broad outline.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I should like to remark at the beginning
of the examination that my document books, of which I
<span class='pageno' title='136' id='Page_136'></span>
have two, have not yet been completely translated. This affidavit,
which the defendant has just mentioned, is also contained in the
document book for the Prosecution. I do not know whether the
Tribunal now has this document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you can go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I was born on 21 April 1900. My father was a civil
servant. I attended the gymnasium to study classics. Then I was a
soldier in the first World War, returned to school, and afterward,
studied philosophy, history, and national economics at various
universities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the first World War my life and my work were determined
by the distress of my people. We called this distress “Versailles.”
Enough has been said here as to the Versailles Treaty. I need add
nothing to what has already been said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: You were striving then in your journalistic work
before 1933 for a change of the Versailles Treaty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you seek this change through war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I sought it through the means of law, of politics,
and economic common sense, which were at that time all on the
German side. Along with this, certain restoration of the power of
the German Reich would have been desirable because I saw in the
weakness of the Reich a potential danger of war. But to change the
Treaty of Versailles by means of war did not seem to me to be
possible, expedient, nor desirable. The same sentiment prevailed
later under the Hitler Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Adolf Hitler gave two assurances on just this point which, for me
and for millions of other Germans, were especially impressive. The
first was the assurance: “I myself was a simple soldier and therefore
know what war means.” The second was the statement: “In all the
bloody wars of the last thousand years not even the victors gained
as much as they had sacrificed in the war.” These two assurances
sounded to German ears like holy and binding oaths. Whatever in
Hitler’s policy should have violated these two assurances was a
betrayal of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: When, how, and why did you come to the NSDAP?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: After my entry into the Propaganda Ministry I
joined the Party. I refer again to my affidavit, 3469-PS, to Points 9
to 13.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did not join the NSDAP on account of the Party program, nor
through Hitler’s book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>; nor did I join because of the
personality of Hitler, whose suggestive power, which has frequently
been mentioned here, escaped me entirely. I rejected the harsh
<span class='pageno' title='137' id='Page_137'></span>
radicalism of the methods of the Party. This harsh radicalism was
contrary to the habits of my whole life and my personal principles.
Due to this coarse practice I even came into a conflict with the
Party in 1932.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I joined the Party when it had, without doubt, won over the
majority of the German people. This Party had overcome, at the
time, the disunion of the German people and brought it unity after
Brüning’s great attempt at recovery on a democratic basis had
failed on account of the foreign political opposition, not because of
the resistance of the German people. After the cabinets also
had failed to find a footing among the people, the appointment of
Hitler, as Reich Chancellor, meant a return to democratic principles.
Much has been said here about these matters. I ask for permission
to cite one circumstance which, to my knowledge, has not yet been
mentioned here and which does have a certain significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I joined the NSDAP I did not believe I was really joining
a party in the true sense of the word, for the NSDAP did not have
a party theory similar to those of the Marxist parties which had a
developed and mature theory; all theorists of the Party were
disputed. The theoretical writings of Gottfried Feder had been
prohibited. The theorist Rosenberg was disputed in the Party to the
very end. The lack of a theory for the Party was so great that even
the printing of the bare Party program was forbidden for the German
papers. The German papers were even forbidden a few years
after 1933 to quote arbitrarily any part of Hitler’s <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time, then, I did not believe that I was joining a narrowly
defined party but I thought I was joining a movement, a movement
which united in itself contrasts such as those between Ley and Funk,
between Rosenberg and the Reich bishop; a movement which was
variable in its choice of methods; which at one time prohibited the
labor of women and at some other time solicited this same labor of
women. I believed I was joining such a movement because one
group within the NSDAP saw in the swastika flag nothing but a
new combination, a new form for the colors black, white, and red,
while another group saw in this banner the red flag with a swastika.
It is a fact that there were whole groups of the former German
Nationalist Party in the NSDAP or of former Communists in the
NSDAP. Thus, I hoped to find in this wide-flung Movement a forum
for intellectual discussions which would no longer be carried on
with the murderous animosity which had previously ruled in Germany
but which could be carried on with a certain discipline
dominated by nationalist and socialist conceptions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason and by making constant compromises, I put aside
my own wishes, my own misgivings, my own political beliefs. In
many conversations I advised my friends to do the same when they
<span class='pageno' title='138' id='Page_138'></span>
complained that they and their interests were not given proper consideration
during the time of the Nazification. I came to the conviction
that millions of Germans had joined the Party only for this
reason and in this expectation. They thought they were serving a
good cause. Out of pure idealism they were willing to sacrifice
everything to this cause, everything except their honor. Meanwhile,
I had to realize that the leader of this cause accepted the sacrifice
of these idealists, that he squandered it, and that, besides, he stained
their honor with a senseless and inhuman murder, unique in
history—a murder which no war necessity could have justified, for
which one could not even find any reason in any necessity of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, the Prosecution accuses you of having—and I
quote, “...sworn the customary oath of unconditional loyalty to
Hitler” in 1933. For whatever reason you did this, the fact that you
took this oath is true, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I also swore, twice, an oath to the Weimar
Constitution, in 1933 and 1938. Let me add something. It was
always and it still is my conviction that no oath relieves a man of
his general duties to humanity. No one is made an irresponsible tool
by an oath. My oath would never have made me carry out an order
if I had recognized it to be criminal. Never in my life did I obey
anyone blindly. For that reason, I do not refer for any of my actions
to my duty to obey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you keep the oath which you took?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. No actions were expected of me which I could
have considered criminal or a violation of written or unwritten
laws. Moreover, I kept the oath which I took, not to Hitler, but to
the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How long did you keep the oath?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I kept it to the end. Then, it is true, I remained in
Berlin, in violation of the order which I was given. When Hitler and
his entourage took the way of suicide or fled toward the West, I
was, to my knowledge, the only higher official to remain in Berlin.
At that time I gathered together the employees of the highest Reich
authorities, who had been left to their fate, in the ruins of my office.
Hitler had left behind an order to fight on. The commander of
Berlin could not be found. Therefore, as a civilian, I felt obliged
to offer to the Russian Marshal Zhukov the capitulation. As I was
sending off the emissaries who were to go across the battleline, the
last military adjutant of Hitler appeared—General Burgdorf—and
was going to shoot me in compliance with Hitler’s order. Nevertheless,
we capitulated, even though it was signed by the commander,
who had been found in the meantime. Thus, I believe I
<span class='pageno' title='139' id='Page_139'></span>
kept my oath, the oath which I had taken to the German people in
the person of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you hold an office in the Party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were you a political leader?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were you in the SA or the SS or any one of the other
organizations which are accused here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you ever take part in a Party rally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In one of the celebrations of 9 November in Munich?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Then, please describe briefly your position and your
work from 1933 to 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Here, again, I may refer to my affidavit, 3469-PS,
that is, to the rest of the affidavit. Thus I may again limit myself
to a very brief presentation to supplement what is said in the
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the seizure of power by National Socialism, I remained what
I had been previously, Chief Editor of Drahtloser Dienst. That was
the name of the German radio news service. I held that position for
5 more years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In May 1933 this wireless service, which had been a part of the
Reich Radio Company, was incorporated into the press section of the
Propaganda Ministry. As I was a specialist in journalistic news
service, I soon was entrusted with the news agencies, first the
smaller ones such as Transozean or Europapress or Eildienst. Later
I was entrusted with the big Deutsches Nachrichtenbüro (German
news service).</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time, I had no power to issue orders to the agencies, for
I was still an employee of the Ministry and not yet an official.
I also had no right to determine the contents of the news. I had
only the organizational supervision, but I believe that my advice
was respected at the time. In those days I also gave other advice of
a journalistic nature. Then in December 1938 I became head of the
German Press Section. I became Ministerial Director. As an official
I still felt like the journalist I had been for decades previously.
I continued to direct the German Press Section until the spring
of 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time I did not agree, among other things, with the
colored press reports of my superior, Reich Press Chief Dr. Dietrich.
For that reason, I became a soldier and went to the Eastern Front.
<span class='pageno' title='140' id='Page_140'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the fall of 1942 I was called back by Dr. Goebbels. Dr. Goebbels
approved my previous criticism, of which he knew. He offered me
the direction of the Radio Section of his Ministry. I answered that
I could return to the Propaganda Ministry only if I had the certainty
that a termination of the war by political means would be
sought and that total military victory would not be striven after,
which from the first day of the war I had considered impossible.
I told Dr. Goebbels at that time literally, “I am not going to participate
as a propagandist in a fight of self—destruction such as was
fought by the Goths at Mount Vesuvius.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Goebbels answered that Hitler and he, also, were seeking a
termination of the war by diplomatic means on the basis of reaching
some sort of understanding. He promised me that he would inform
me in time if he noticed that the Führer was changing these
intentions. Dr. Goebbels repeated this promise at intervals of a few
months, up to the end of the war; and each time that he repeated
it, he always gave me substantiated indications about the political
efforts in progress at the moment. Today I have the feeling that he
broke his promise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, at that time I took over the Radio Section of the Propaganda
Ministry, and I became Ministerial Director.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Those were your official positions. But they were
less known to the public. Better known were your radio speeches.
What about them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Since 1932 I spoke once a week, for 10 to 15 minutes,
on some German stations and on the Deutschlandsender (radio
station for foreign broadcasts). At the beginning of the war I spoke
daily on all the stations, I believe for 3 or 4 months. Then I spoke
three times a week, then twice a week, and finally once a week
again. At first these radio speeches were just reviews of newspaper
articles; that is, a collection of quotations from domestic and foreign
newspapers. After the beginning of the war, however, these speeches,
of course, became a polemic on the basis of quotations mostly from
foreign papers and foreign radio stations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did your speeches have an official character? The
Prosecution says that they were, of course, under the control of the
Propaganda Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is not correct in that form. The speeches were
not official. At the beginning they were purely personal elaborations.
Of course, I could not prevent, as time went on, the private
speeches of a man holding a position in the Propaganda Ministry
being no longer considered as personal, but semi-official.
<span class='pageno' title='141' id='Page_141'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: You just said “personal elaborations,” which was
later considered “semi-official.” For clarification I ask, could one
criticize these speeches, or was one arrested for so doing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Criticism was not only allowed, but actually it was
done. I had an extensive correspondence with my critics, although
only with those who signed their names. There were of course also
anonymous critics, but I may add that the anonymous critics had
only general complaints.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the outbreak of the war a South German office of public
prosecution and later the Ministry of Justice, offered me a certain
protection for my publications, apparently on the assumption that
they were official or semi-official. It was suggested to me to appear
as co-plaintiff in possible libel actions. I categorically refused this,
stating, as I have often done both privately and publicly, that
people must be allowed to grumble about something. If they are
forbidden to criticize the State and the Government, then they must
be allowed at least to criticize the press, the radio, and me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How did you prepare these speeches? Were they
put down in writing and censored beforehand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I always refused to let them be censored beforehand.
The material was gathered very carefully. It was kept in the
so-called “Archiv-Schnelldienst” which had been applied for and
approved by the Tribunal to be brought here but which could not
be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The material consisted of clippings from papers, reports of news
agencies, and reports from foreign broadcasts. The investigation of
doubtful matters was done by a special official. A rough draft of
the speech was then dictated and then delivered freely. Therefore,
this procedure was different to that of writing an article; not every
sentence had to be polished, because in a written matter every word
counts, whereas in a speech it is more the total impression which
is decisive.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, you worked in the Propaganda Ministry;
Dr. Goebbels was the Minister. His name has been mentioned here
frequently in connection with his various positions as Reich Minister
for Propaganda, Reich Propaganda Director of the NSDAP, Delegate
for Total War Effort, and Gauleiter of Berlin. In which of these
capacities did you deal with Dr. Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Exclusively in his capacity as Propaganda Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were you his representative there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. In the last 2½ years I was his commissioner
for radio broadcasting and, in addition, head of one of the 12 departments
of his Ministry. Dr. Goebbels’ representatives were his state
<span class='pageno' title='142' id='Page_142'></span>
secretaries. The last one was Dr. Naumann who was his successor
for one day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Was Dr. Goebbels your only and direct superior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. There were many offices between him and me
at first, and still a few later on. This is the first time, here in the
dock, that I am without official superiors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: By the way, whom of the defendants did you know
or with whom did you have official or personal relations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I had two or three official conversations, shortly
after 1933, with Funk, who was then State Secretary in the Propaganda
Ministry, mainly dealing with economic and organizational
matters. I discussed with him the financial plans for the reorganization
of the news service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, I once had a talk with Grossadmiral Dönitz on a technical
matter. I called on Seyss-Inquart in The Hague, and on Papen in
Istanbul. I knew all the others only by sight and first made their
personal acquaintance during the Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How about Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I never had a conversation with him. In the
course of 12 years, however, I saw him, of course, several times at
the Reichstag on big occasions or receptions. Once I was at his
headquarters and was invited to dinner with a large number of
other people. Otherwise, I received instructions from Hitler only
through Dr. Dietrich or his representative or through Dr. Goebbels
and his various representatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What were your relations with Dr. Goebbels? Were
you on friendly terms with him? Did you meet with him frequently?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: One can by no means say that we were friends.
The relationship was on an official basis, reserved and to a certain
extent formal. I was personally even less frequently with him than
other assistants of Dr. Goebbels of my rank. But I believed I observed
that he treated me with more respect than any other of his
co-workers. To that extent, I occupied a certain special position.
I valued Dr. Goebbels’ intelligence and his ability, at least sometimes,
to change his own opinion in favor of a better argument. I
saw him about twice a year during the first 5 years. When I was
head of a department I saw him perhaps once a month. After the
outbreak of war I saw him daily in the course of a conference with
30 to 50 fellow employees; and in addition, about once a week I
had a conference on special subjects with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now we come to the subject of propaganda. Can
you sketch the propaganda system in the Third Reich?
<span class='pageno' title='143' id='Page_143'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I shall try it. There were three types of propaganda.
The first was the unorganized agitation of the radical
fanatics in the Party. It was present in all fields, in the fields of
religion, racial policy, art, general policy, and the conduct of the
war. As time went by Martin Bormann became more and more
the leader of this unorganized agitation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second type of propaganda was under the Reich Propaganda
Directorate of the NSDAP. The head of this was Dr. Goebbels. It
attempted to put the agitation of the radicals on a more presentable
basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third type was the state organization of the Reich Propaganda
Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Prosecution contended at the beginning that
you had been also head of the Radio Section of the Propaganda
Directorate of the NSDAP. How about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The Prosecution have withdrawn that assertion.
They said that they had no proof. It would have been more correct
to say that this statement has been proved to be false. I refer to my
affidavit, 3469-PS, Point 37. There I state that I was not—in contrast
to all of my predecessors, as far as I know—head of the Radio
Section of the Ministry and at the same time head of the Radio
Section of the Party. Today I supplement this statement by saying
that I held no office whatever in the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: You have been accused of having helped Dr. Goebbels
plunge the world into the blood-bath of aggressive war. Is that
true? Did Dr. Goebbels ever speak with you about aggressive plans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No; I never heard of any intention to wage aggressive
war, either from Dr. Goebbels or from anyone else.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In the course of this Trial some conferences have
been mentioned here several times at which, it was said, various
aggressive plans were discussed; for example, before the attack on
Czechoslovakia, before the attack on Poland, and on Norway, and
on Russia. Did you participate in these conferences? Did you hear
of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I did not participate in a single one of these conferences.
I heard of them for the first time here in the courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, in case no plans for an attack were discussed
in these conferences, was there any talk at all about war or the
possibility of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No; but the danger of war was mentioned as early
as 1933—the danger of war due to the one-sided disarmament of one
state in the midst of other states which were highly armed. This
disproportion between armament and nonarmament had to be considered
as enticing an attack.
<span class='pageno' title='144' id='Page_144'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>German propaganda after 1933 underlined this consideration and
this contention as one of the main reasons, first, for the demand for
disarmament of the other powers and afterwards for the German
demand for equality of armament. That seemed completely logical
to me. But never was the danger of war mentioned without, at the
same time, making a reference to the German will for peace. That
seemed to me honest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the summer of 1939, when the danger of war became more
and more imminent, I saw Dr. Goebbels more often than ever before.
I gave Dr. Goebbels a number of little memoranda as, so to speak,
a contribution from my field of work, the news service. They were
analyses of public opinion in western countries, and they repeatedly
indicated that England was determined to go to war in case of a
conflict with Poland. I recall that Dr. Goebbels was deeply impressed
when I once again gave him one of these memoranda. He
expressed his concern and decided immediately to fly to Hitler. He
said to me, literally, “Believe me, we did not work successfully for
6 years in order to risk everything in a war now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, in the summer of 1939, I knew of some serious
gaps in German armament which have already been mentioned in
part here in the courtroom. Therefore I was convinced of the
honesty of the peaceful intentions in Hitler’s policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If documents have been submitted during this Trial which indicate
that Hitler secretly thought differently or acted differently,
then I am at a loss to form a judgment, since the documents of the
opposite side have not yet been published. But if it should be, as
the documents submitted here say, I must state that I was deceived
about the aims of German policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, at the beginning of my case I had
stated that we were unable to produce here the radio speeches of
the Defendant Fritzsche. I tried to obtain them from German radio
stations and succeeded in getting at least a small part from the
years 1939 and 1940. I have selected a few of these speeches which
I should like to submit to the Tribunal as Exhibit Number Fritzsche-1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To support what the defendant has just said, I should like to
quote only one sentence from the radio speech of Fritzsche of
15 November 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The sole reason for war, which a nation that as a whole
never longs for war, may have at all—the sole reason for war
which is also morally justifiable is the threat to the existence,
to the life of that nation.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And this line emphasized by the Defendant Fritzsche at the
beginning of the war, was adhered to by him during the war as
<span class='pageno' title='145' id='Page_145'></span>
well. As proof of this, I should like to quote another passage from
the same document, from a radio speech of Fritzsche of 23 July 1940:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We Germans have experienced in the course of our history,
and especially 30 years ago, enough blood and tears and death
to face things honestly now. We knew what war meant, and
therefore we did not want war. And because the Führer
knows it so well and had experienced it himself, he offered
on 6 October and 19 July to make peace.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you in any way have anything to do with war
preparations of an intellectual or organizational kind?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Not directly, but perhaps indirectly. I demanded
the disarmament of the others, and then equality of armament; and
I advocated the arming (Wehrhaftmachung) of the German people.
The expression “Wehrhaftmachung” is liable to be misunderstood,
at any rate, to be easily misinterpreted. I should like to define it
expressly as the ability to fight in self-defense. The German people
were promised again and again, often by me, that the restoration of
military sovereignty would be for defensive purposes only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How and where did you propagate this idea?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In the modest sphere of my weekly radio speeches,
while making casual remarks. I was a patriot; but I feel myself
to be free from chauvinism, that is, exaggerated nationalism. To
me, as a historian, it was at that time already clear that, especially
in the narrow confines of Europe, the old nationalism was an
anachronism and that it was incompatible with modern communications
and weapons. At that time I believed I saw in Hitler’s
doctrine also certain elements for a new type of mutual understanding
among peoples. It was particularly the constantly repeated
thesis that only the nationalism of one people can understand the
nationalism of another people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only today have I realized ideologically—but particularly, of
course materially—through the further development of arms, that
the time of nationalism is past, if mankind does not want to commit
suicide, and that the period of internationalism has come, for good
or evil.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time, however, nationalism was not considered a crime.
Everyone advocated it. It can be seen that it is still advocated today,
and I also advocated it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, the Prosecution points out that before every
attack a press campaign was launched in Germany, the aim of which
was to weaken the victim of a planned attack and to prepare the
German people psychologically for the new drive. Although this is
stated by the Prosecution without as yet actually referring to you
personally and even though later no direct charge is made that you
<span class='pageno' title='146' id='Page_146'></span>
organized these press campaigns, the Prosecution, nevertheless,
stress very strongly your connection with this practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, what facts do you have to state about your role in these
journalistic polemics?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: First, I can only point out that I described the
propagandistic actions in detail in my affidavit, Document Number
3469-PS, Points 23 to 33, starting with the Rhineland occupation
up to the attack on the Soviet Union. These descriptions also contain
information about the type and extent of my participation in these
actions. Beyond that, I may emphasize that any reference is missing
in the description made in my affidavit as to the question of the
right in each case. All attempts at political justification are lacking.
I should like to emphasize explicitly that in each case, in each
action, I believed I represented a good and just cause. It would be
leading too far if I were to explain that here for each case, inasmuch
as many of these cases have already been discussed here. I
assume, or rather I hope, that the Prosecution will ask questions on
this subject for I assert that, no matter what the facts may have
been in the individual cases, at every moment from the Anschluss
of Austria on to the attack on Russia, information given to me and
through me to the German public left no doubt of the legality or
the urgent necessity of the German action; and I, as the only surviving
informer of the German public, consider it my duty to be
available here for any investigation of the correctness of this statement
of mine, which is of especial importance for the German public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Some newspaper headlines are mentioned in your
affidavit which are considered typical for the various states of
tension prior to the individual action. What have you to say to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The headlines are taken without exception from
the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>. These headlines were submitted to me
and, of course, I had to confirm their truth; but I may emphasize
that the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> was not typical for the result of my
press policy. The <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> generally had its own
direct connections to headquarters and to Hitler. Typical products
of my press policy were papers such as the <span class='it'>Deutsche Allgemeine
Zeitung</span>, the <span class='it'>Münchener Neueste Nachrichten</span>, and the <span class='it'>Hamburger
Fremdenblatt</span>, to name only a few.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: But the Prosecution is of the opinion that you also
incited to war by your domestic propaganda insofar as you tried
to arouse hostile feelings in the German people toward other peoples
of Europe and the world. In Captain Sprecher’s trial brief it is said,
for instance, that terms like “antagonism against the peoples of the
Soviet Union” and “an atmosphere of senselessness and hatred”
were created by you or that you had incited the Germans to blind
hatred. Did you do that?
<span class='pageno' title='147' id='Page_147'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I did not do that. Never did I attempt to arouse
hatred against the English, French, Americans, or Russians, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.
There is not a single word of this type in perhaps a thousand
speeches which I made before the microphone. I did speak strongly
against governments, members of governments, governmental
systems; but I never preached hatred generally or attempted to
awaken it indirectly as was the case—and I ask your pardon for my
taking an example from the courtroom—at the moment when a film
was presented here and the words were spoken, “Here you see
Germans laughing over hanged Yugoslavs.” Never did I try to
awaken hatred in this general form and I may point out that for
years many anti-National Socialist statements from certain countries,
which were still neutral at that time, remained unanswered.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did your superiors demand that you mark your
propaganda with the stamp of antagonism or to stimulate hatred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, that happened frequently, but it was not
demanded that antagonism or hatred should be stirred up against
peoples. That was expressly forbidden because we wanted to win
these peoples over to our side, but again and again I was requested
to arouse hatred against individuals and against systems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Who requested you to do this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Dr. Goebbels, Dr. Dietrich, and both of them
frequently on the direct orders of Adolf Hitler. The reproach was
repeatedly made that the German press and the German radio did
not arouse hatred at all against Roosevelt, Churchill, or Stalin but
that they made these three personalities popular as efficient men.
For that reason, for years the German press was forbidden to
mention these three names at all unless, in an individual case,
permission was given with exact instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Do you mean to say that you refused the request
to change your propaganda to incite antagonism and to arouse
hatred and did not carry it out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I should like to outline exactly what I did. When
the reproaches of Dr. Goebbels and Dr. Dietrich accumulated, I had
all caricatures from the first and second World War collected—from
England, the United States of America, France, and a few from
Russia. In addition, I had all anti-German propaganda films which
I could lay my hands on, collected. Then in five to six demonstrations
of several hours each, I presented these caricatures and these
films to German journalists and German radio speakers. I, myself,
spoke only 2 or 3 minutes in introduction. It is quite possible that
I created hatred through these showings, but I should like to leave
the judgment of this means of producing hatred in the midst of
<span class='pageno' title='148' id='Page_148'></span>
war to the Tribunal. In any case, Dr. Goebbels said later that he
was dissatisfied and we were “bunglers.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>I may add one statement. I would have had a means of carrying
out my orders of arousing real hatred, that is, not one means but
a whole group of methods; that would have been, to give only one
example, a German edition of the last two volumes of the Tarzan
series, an adventure series which was very popular in Germany at
that time and of which the last two volumes were strongly anti-German.
I need not describe them here. I never pointed out such
early products of anti-German propaganda. I always deliberately
ignored such methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: If you say that you dispensed with hatred and
antagonism in your propaganda, what means did you use in your
propaganda during the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: During the war I conducted the propaganda
almost exclusively with the concept of the necessity and the obligation
to fight. I repeatedly painted the results of defeat very dark
and systematically I gave quotations from the press and the radio
of the enemy countries. I quoted repeatedly the enemy demands
for unconditional surrender. I used the expression of the “super-Versailles”
frequently and did—I emphasize that—describe the consequences
of a lost war very pessimistically. It does not behoove
me today to make a comparison with reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: But could you not learn from the broadcasts of the
enemy that the fight of the Allies was not directed against the
German people but only against its leaders? Did you keep that
from the German people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: On the contrary, I did not keep it from them, but
repeatedly quoted it. However, I called it “incredible.” For
example, I once used the trick of quoting the wording of a medieval
declaration of war in which it had already been said that a war was
declared only on the King of France but that one wanted to bring
freedom to the French people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 27 June 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='149' id='Page_149'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-FIFTH DAY</span><br/> Thursday, 27 June 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Fritzsche resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL (Lieutenant Colonel James R. Gifford): If it please
the Tribunal, the report is made that Defendant Ribbentrop is
absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal, first a
very brief explanation: Yesterday I repeatedly mentioned the Indictment
and intend to do so in the course of the examination. Thereby
I mean the presentation of Fritzsche’s case by Captain Sprecher in
the morning session of 23 January 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Fritzsche, yesterday you spoke of your radio speeches concerning
the Allied propaganda—my last question: Did you attempt
to split the front of the Allies by your propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course I attempted to do that. I elaborated on
all ideological and all practical political contrasts or differences
between the individual Allied nations. I considered that a permissible
method of waging war. At that time I wanted a split between
the Allies just as much as today I wish their unity, since Germany
would be the first victim of any conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, you are accused of assisting in establishing
Nazi control throughout Germany. Did you agitate against
democracy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I never agitated against democracy as such. I
attacked the democracy of the 36 parties, the democracy which had
prevailed in Germany previously, the democracy under which even
strong groups such as the two Marxist parties, for example, were
powerless. I criticized foreign democracy only on two points: First,
the elements which limited the basic concept of democracy—I
believe it is superfluous and perhaps it would be misunderstood to
enumerate them today. Secondly, I criticized the demands of the
foreign democracies to force their form of government on us.
According to my knowledge and information at that time, it seemed
unjustified to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Well, did you consider dictatorship a better form
of government?
<span class='pageno' title='150' id='Page_150'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I should like to emphasize that at that time, under
the existing conditions and only for a temporary emergency period,
I did; today, of course, no. After the totalitarian form of government
has brought about the catastrophe of the murder of 5 millions, I
consider this form of government wrong even in times of emergency.
I believe any kind of democratic control, even a restricted democratic
control, would have made such a catastrophe impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: You are accused, furthermore, of having spread the
doctrine of the “master race.” The Prosecution makes this charge
indirectly against you. How about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I never set up or voiced the theory of the “master
race.” I even avoided this term. I expressly prohibited this term
being used by the German press and the German radio when I was
in charge of one or the other. I believe that the term “master race”
played a greater role in the anti-National Socialist propaganda than
in Germany proper. I do not know who invented this term. To my
knowledge it was publicly mentioned only by men like Dr. Ley,
for example, men—and I must explain this frankly and expressly—who
were not taken seriously by anyone in this connection. It is
true, however, that this term played a great role, without being
expressed openly, among the SS because of its racial exclusiveness;
but people of intelligence, tact and insight, and with some knowledge
of the world, very carefully avoided the use of this word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, at this opportunity, I should like to
offer an affidavit to the Tribunal by Dr. Scharping of 17 May 1946.
Dr. Scharping was Government Counsellor in the Propaganda
Ministry up to the end. From this affidavit I shall now quote only
one sentence from Page 13. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In this connection it can be explained that Fritzsche always
opposed the term ‘the master race.’ He even expressly
prohibited the use of this word on the radio.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] But the Prosecution has quoted a
passage from one of your radio speeches to prove this assertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The quotation is correct, but I ask you just to
read it carefully. The term “master race” is rejected in this quotation
for the Jewish and for the German people. The quotation cannot
be misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, that is in Captain Sprecher’s speech
for the Prosecution, English text, Pages 31 and 32.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] But you carried on propaganda not
only in Germany, but also abroad. What was the difference?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In my radio speeches there was no difference.
Before the outbreak of war I made a slight difference in the speeches
<span class='pageno' title='151' id='Page_151'></span>
for Germany and those for other countries simply because the
audience was different, and because I had to presuppose a different
level of knowledge. During the war my speeches on the Reich German
radio were simply transmitted over the short-wave stations.
What was said for Germany or for other countries could be controlled
by both sides. Moreover in the 12 years during which I spoke
on the German radio, I never permitted my speeches to be translated,
since that always involved a differentiation in emphasis. Written
articles can be translated, perhaps official speeches also, but not
rather light and half-improvised chats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were your broadcasts abroad criticized internationally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, very frequently. During the war there was
often daily criticism from some country or other. I had these
criticisms collected. I asked for them as documents, but my application
was refused by the Court. As far as I know, I am not accused
of inciting war in these criticisms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now you not only acted as a mouthpiece for propaganda,
but also as an organizer of it. You are accused of having
helped to create an important instrument for the alleged conspiracy.
The Prosecution says that for 13 years you aided in the creation
of the propaganda machine which the conspiracy was able to put
to such good use. Did you create the press organization of the
National Socialist State?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I did not create this organization nor did I
have any part in its creation. It was created by Dr. Goebbels,
Dr. Dietrich, and Reichsleiter Amann. When, in the winter of 1938,
I became head of the so-called German Press Section, I attempted
to loosen the bonds which had been imposed on the German press.
I attempted that in the material and personnel field. For example,
I called back to their work with the press hundreds of editors of
other parties who had been dismissed in 1933 and 1934. Today they
will be angry with me. I had the best intentions at that time. In
addition to the official press conferences which were very strictly
controlled, also as far as their records were concerned, by my
superiors, I also arranged the so-called supplementary conferences
in which I met the representatives of the 50 or 60 most important
papers and discussed more freely the possibilities of their work.
I coined the slogan which was often used there: “You may write
any criticism you like in the German papers provided such criticism
is not shown in big headlines but is buried somewhere in the text
in an elegant form.” Very many German journalists made use of
this possibility in the past 12 years. I should be glad if this work,
which was hidden work, would be honored in some way today in
<span class='pageno' title='152' id='Page_152'></span>
the interest of these people who, in part, returned to their profession
as journalists only out of personal confidence in me. Of
course, I must add that the possibility of criticizing was not unlimited.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, on this occasion, with the approval
of the Prosecution, I offer the Tribunal a document as Document
Number Fritzsche-4. It is an excerpt from a letter of the German
Lieutenant General Dittmar, who frequently commented on the
military situation on the German radio during the war and who
is in British captivity. The well-known English radio commentator,
Mr. Liddell-Hart, has sent an excerpt from the letter to the British
Prosecution. I should like to quote briefly this memorandum which
was sent to me. May I quote this passage?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, you may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Dittmar writes that the possibility of retaining the
critical attitude in his radio commentary is due primarily to the
silent approval and the protection of Hans Fritzsche, the director of
the political radio. He believes that Fritzsche was a secret opponent of
the regime and that he was glad of the opportunity to have found
a commentator who discreetly expressed ideas which resembled
his own and which insidiously would tend to reduce confidence in
the regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following this quotation, there is another quotation from the
affidavit of Dr. Scharping, which I have already submitted as Document
Number Fritzsche-2. It is on Page 11 of this affidavit. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The radio men and the journalists knew Fritzsche’s tolerance
quite well. It repeatedly happened that, for example, Fritzsche
at his conference had a copy of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> in
his hand and commented ironically on an anti-Jewish article.
I recall that once he expressed his criticism in about the
following words:</p>

<p>“ ‘A Berlin paper’—then he held up the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>
so that everyone could see it—‘has once more, in an editorial,
made more than two blunders. Perhaps the publisher may
yet succeed in hitting the right tune.’</p>

<p>“With such ironical remarks, Fritzsche always had the approval
of his listeners, but there was some danger for him, for
Goebbels daily read the records of these press conferences.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Fritzsche, following the statement of Lieutenant General
Dittmar, one question: Did you feel yourself to be an enemy of the
system, or how does General Dittmar come to this statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I was not an enemy of the system. It would be
ridiculous and unworthy to try to assert that today. But I was
<span class='pageno' title='153' id='Page_153'></span>
definitely an opponent of all misuse of the system. The obvious
one which I noticed the most, because it was in my field of work,
was whitewashing of news during the war. The aim of all my
news policy was realism, and apparently that is what General Dittmar
means in the part of his statement which has been read here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I met General Dittmar in December 1942 or January 1943 at
the moment when the German 6th Army at Stalingrad was already
surrounded, but when this fact was still being kept secret from
the German people. Together with General Dittmar, in face of the
prohibition, I publicly announced the fact that the 6th Army was
surrounded at Stalingrad. This caused a great sensation at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the following months and years I always defended General
Dittmar and his realistic presentation of the military situation
against all attacks, especially against the attacks of the Party, but
also against the attacks of the Foreign Office, which repeatedly
pointed out that these sober presentations of Dittmar had a bad
effect on Germany’s allies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this struggle for realistic news service, later—and
I ask permission to mention this briefly—I waged a desperate
battle against the irresponsible propaganda of miracle weapons.
Only 1 year after Dr. Goebbels had mentioned the future miracle
weapons did I mention a new type of weapon for the first time.
Speer has mentioned SS Standartenführer Berg, who is said to have
carried on secret propaganda for the miracle weapon in connection
with the Propaganda Ministry. He wrote an article in <span class='it'>Das Reich</span>
which attracted much attention, with the sensational and very
promising heading, “We, the Bearers of Secrets.” I had to fight
against things like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another especially striking example was this: Another member
of the SS, Hernau, wrote, at the moment when the invasion had
succeeded, an article in which he presented the situation as if the
evacuation of France had been a very secret trick of the German
Command, which offered the possibility for a particularly strong
counterblow. I prohibited this article in my field, and I repeatedly
had to oppose the irresponsible rumors which were spread in secret
about mysterious weapons. I did so publicly, and I plainly stated
my point of view on the radio against this propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand I may point out that at every moment of the
war my superiors always made well-founded promises to me, first,
of some military offensive which was just being prepared; for
instance, a thrust from East Prussia toward the south, a thrust
from Upper Silesia to the Vistula, a thrust from Alsace toward
the north, and so forth. Hand in hand with these promises, which
were thoroughly detailed, were the political promises which were
<span class='pageno' title='154' id='Page_154'></span>
mentioned briefly yesterday, that is, the descriptions given by
Dr. Goebbels that foreign political negotiations were in progress
with the enemy on one or the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Another question: Who was in charge of press
policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Reich Press Chief Dr. Dietrich. He gave very
specialized instructions, mostly in a precise wording, the so-called
“slogan of the day of the Reich Press Chief.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Generally he even gave the wording of the commentaries which
were to be added in the press conference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the most part, Dr. Dietrich was at the Führer’s headquarters
and received his instructions directly from Hitler. Dr. Dietrich’s
representatives were Sündermann and Lorenz. The second factor
decisive for German press policy was Reichsleiter Amann who was
at the head of the organization of publishers. The third factor was
Dr. Goebbels as Reich Propaganda Minister. Dietrich and Amann
were nominally subordinate to him; actually, both had the same
authority as he had and I always had to adjust differences or co-ordinate
among these three authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you create the organization of the journalistic
news service?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I did create this organization. In principle, it
originated with me. I may refer to my affidavit, 3469-PS, Point 17.
I was in charge of the journalistic news service from about 1934
to 1938. I was proud of the fact that at the beginning of the war
even the enemy recognized the good functioning of this news
machine. However, at that time I was no longer the head of the so-called
news service department. As an expert I created this
organization in peacetime without thinking of the possibility of using
it during war. The conclusion of the Prosecution that I also
determined the contents of the news service is not correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Prosecution has said that the Propaganda
Ministry was the most fabulous lie factory of all times. What do
you have to say about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: First, for myself personally, I should like to make
the following quite clear. I state under oath: On really serious questions
of policy and the conduct of war I did not commit a single
falsification and did not consciously use a single lie.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How often I myself became the victim of a falsehood or a lie
I cannot say after the revelations of this Trial. The same is true,
as far as I know, of all my fellow workers, but I do not by any
means want to deny that I and my fellow workers selected news
<span class='pageno' title='155' id='Page_155'></span>
and quotations following a certain tendency. It is the curse of propaganda
during war that one works only with black and white. Only
a few great minds remain independent. I believe that this painting
in black and white is a luxury which also cannot be afforded any
longer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the Propaganda Ministry itself, as such, I must say that
I can only judge of the one-twelfth, that is the one section of which
I was in charge at any time. But to my knowledge it is a mistake
to believe that in the Propaganda Ministry thousands of little lies
were hatched out. In details we worked quite cleanly and honestly,
technically even perfectly. If we had lied on a thousand small
things, the enemy would have been able to deal with us more
easily than was the case. But decisive for such a news machine is
not the detail but the final fundamental basis on which propaganda
is built. Decisive is the belief in the incorruptibility of the leaders
of the state, on which every journalist must rely and this basis
is shaken by what has become known today of mass murders, of
senseless atrocities, and it is shaken by the doubt in the honesty
of Hitler’s protestations for peace, the factual details of which
I am not in a position to judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In this Trial it has been pointed out that there
are no regulations in international law on the methods of propaganda
in war and peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I know very well that international law places
no restrictions on propaganda, especially propaganda during war.
I also know very well that only in a very few individual treaties
between states are there regulations about the use of propaganda;
for example in the German-Polish treaty and in the German-Soviet
Union treaty. But in all my life as a journalist I have
emphasized that the lack of international regulations as to propaganda
is no excuse for lies. I always emphasized the moral
responsibility of the journalist and newsman. I did so long before
the war in an international discussion with Radio Luxembourg but
it would lead too far afield to go into that here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If last May I did not seek death, one of the reasons for this
was my wish—I wanted to render an account of where, in that
system, there were the pure idealism and the heroic sacrifices of
millions, and where there were lies and the brutality which did
not shrink from committing crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Please give us examples of cases wherein you felt
you were deceived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: During this Trial the news was discussed which
circulated at the beginning of the Polish war about the attack on
the Gleiwitz radio station. At that time I firmly believed in the
<span class='pageno' title='156' id='Page_156'></span>
truth of the official German news. I need say nothing about this
case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in December of last year, here in the prison in Nuremberg,
I realized from a talk with Grand Admiral Raeder that it
was actually a German submarine which sank the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>. Up to
that time I had firmly believed in the truth of the official German
report that there had been no German submarine in the neighborhood.
I have asked my lawyer to pick out the most caustic
statements I made in my radio speeches about the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> case and
include them in my document book. They are utterances which
would really speak against me but which, on the other hand, show
that I worked not alone on the basis of the official German news,
but that I also collected the news which supported the official German
version; for example, the fact which was not at first made
public and therefore was suspicious, that the wreck of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>,
one day after the catastrophe, was sunk by being shelled by British
destroyers, which is a matter of course in the interest of shipping
but which at the time seemed to me to be an occasion for suspicion.
I also used American news on the same subject. But the
most impressive false news of which I was a victim was given out
in the last few days of the war. I must describe it for the sake
of clearing up matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the days when Berlin was surrounded by the Russian Army
the people of Berlin were told that a relief army, the army of
General Wenk, was marching on Berlin; that there was no more
fighting on the Western Front. The news was given out that Ribbentrop
had gone to the Western Front and had concluded a treaty
there, and handbills were printed in Berlin which contained approximately
this text: “Soldiers of the Wenk army, we Berliners know
that you are as far as Potsdam. Hurry, come quickly, help us.”
These handbills were printed at a time when the Wenk army no
longer existed and had already been captured. These handbills
were apparently dropped over Berlin inadvertently and were to
give the inhabitants of Berlin new courage. That happened in the
days when Hitler, according to Speer’s testimony, had already told
his entourage that there was no use trying to do anything for the
rest of the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, the two radio speeches which the
Defendant Fritzsche has mentioned dealing with the Athenia case
are in the Document Number Fritzsche-1, which I submitted yesterday.
I refer only to the contents of these radio speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Please give examples of untruths
which you knew and which you did not consider lies.
<span class='pageno' title='157' id='Page_157'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: One example is the so-called “V” drive. Colonel
Britton, a British colonel, proclaimed this “V” drive, this “Victory”
drive on the British radio. On the same evening I stood
before a German microphone and said, apparently harmlessly, “We
will have a ‘V’ drive; the ‘V’ stands for ‘Victoria.’ ”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Colonel Britton said that I had stolen the “V” from him.
I said that was not the case, that I thought of it first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: If you thought you were operating only with the
truth, why your sharp language, why the prohibition against
listening on the radio to foreign stations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I have already emphasized in my affidavit that in
my opinion the sharpness of my language was always less than
that of my opponents. The prohibition against listening to foreign
radio stations was issued decidedly against my will. This prohibition
was only a hindrance for me in my discussions with my
foreign opponents in the various countries. Due to this prohibition
my enemy was, so to speak, half in shadow; I could not speak to
him officially, but, on the other hand, I knew that many of my
listeners had heard him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I mention here that I always advocated a mild judgment
on the violators of this prohibition against listening to foreign
radio stations. Legal authorities often consulted me as an expert.
I may emphasize that, particularly after Stalingrad, I established
my own listening service for the Russian radio in order to learn
the names of German soldiers captured at Stalingrad which were
mentioned on the Russian radio and report them to the relatives,
because it seemed cruel to me to deprive the relatives of such a
source of information about the fate of their people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, there was only one alternative with regard to the
prohibition of listening to the radio. That was either to confiscate
all radios and stop the whole German radio system—the Party
often demanded this—or the prohibition against listening to foreign
stations, which seemed to me the lesser of the two evils.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, we were in a war, and the enemy was not too particular
in his methods. I should like to give an example. That was
the station Gustav Siegfried 2, which at the beginning of its work
gained listeners in Germany with stories that I do not want to
characterize more precisely but which caused me to prohibit my
own listening station from receiving this broadcast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: You have been charged with urging a policy of ruthless
exploitation of the occupied territories. Do you acknowledge
such a policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. The aim of all my propaganda work in Europe
was, and had to be, to win over the peoples of Europe to the
<span class='pageno' title='158' id='Page_158'></span>
German cause. Anything else would have been illogical. All the
radio broadcasts in all European languages, which were made under
my direction, had for years only one aim: That was to win the
voluntary co-operation, especially of the occupied territories, for
the fight of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were you of the opinion that the German administration
in the occupied territories recruited voluntary co-operation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: At the beginning, certainly, with one single
exception. That was Koch in the Ukraine. Otherwise, as far as I
could see, all administrations of occupied territories sought this
collaboration more or less skillfully. I saw the gigantic efforts which
the Allies made to interfere with this German collaboration policy,
which was very dangerous for them. I saw that in these efforts the
Allies were at first using their means of propaganda. This alone
would not have worked. Then I saw that they used other means in
these efforts, that is, outrages and sabotage. These latter efforts
had great success. Outrages always called for reprisals and reprisals
always called forth new outrages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I hope I will not be misunderstood, and this is not meant cynically,
if I say the following: I, as a propagandist, considered for
example the murder of Heydrich a minor success. The destruction
of Lidice, carried out by the Germans, however, was a tremendous
success for the Allies. In other words, I always was and had to be
an opponent of reprisals of all kinds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you know of the reprisals? How did you deal
with them in your propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I learned of Lidice, which I just mentioned, only
after months, because at that time I was at the Eastern Front. I
learned—and this is significant—only of the destruction of the
houses of Lidice and the driving out of the inhabitants. I learned
only here in the courtroom of the killing of a part of the inhabitants.
I learned that hostages were taken, but not that they were
killed. The killing of hostages was made public only in the occupied
territories. If shootings occurred anywhere, I was told that they
had been of persons condemned to death on account of outrages or
conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Night and Fog Decree was also unknown to me. On the
other hand, I frequently learned of fines which had been imposed
on towns or districts. In our propaganda, we always referred to the
causes of such reprisals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And how did you describe the work of the German
administrations in your propaganda?
<span class='pageno' title='159' id='Page_159'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I always referred to the constructive work which,
in spite of all difficulties and all resistance, was being done in the
various occupied territories, especially and far ahead, the work
for the intensification of agriculture; then that to increase industrial
production. I had references made to the supplying of the
occupied territories with food, often, as I should like to emphasize,
from scant German stocks. I had reports made of the creation of
schools, and I received at times very impressive reports and had
them worked on, for example, on the supplying of cities such as
Paris, in spite of sabotage by the enemy against railroad lines or
other supply channels. I had such reports collected in permanent
files and had speeches and whole series of speeches made on them.
There were many such reports. I must emphasize that, as far as I
know, in not a single German-occupied territory was there an infant
mortality of 80 percent, and in none were there fields lying fallow,
and it is simply not true, as the Prosecution said here once,
although in a moment of excitement, that Germany and the Germans
were well fed and happy during the war while the occupied
territories starved. That is not true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What did you know about bad conditions in the
occupied territories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Above all, the failure to call on the population for
their own administration and the lack of decisive political concessions
to the countries which administered themselves. Immediately after
the French campaign, I had repeatedly demanded the establishment
of a Magna Charta for Europe, laying down the basic rights of the
European peoples. I prepared many memoranda on this subject
which were accepted by Dr. Goebbels and taken to Hitler; and
when in the autumn of 1942 I decided to return to the Propaganda
Ministry, one of the promises which Dr. Goebbels gave me was
that now finally that Magna Charta for Europe would be proclaimed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, on this occasion I should like to
quote a passage from the Scharping affidavit, Document Number
Fritzsche-2, Page 13 of the affidavit:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After the occupation of various European countries, Fritzsche
issued directives for news releases to the effect that the
peoples of Europe were to form a league of states on the
basis of equality with Germany. He told me to work out
a series of speeches to this effect in which this point of view
was to play the decisive role and which at the same time
should give the authorities hints for a healthy reconstruction
in the occupied territories.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Did you know what has been said
here by the Prosecution about the activity of the Police in the
occupied territories?
<span class='pageno' title='160' id='Page_160'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: At this point I should like to interpolate a question:
I have already asked the witness Paulus about your conduct after
you learned of the Commissar Order. How about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I learned of the order to shoot captured Soviet
commissars at the beginning of May 1942 when I came to the
6th Army. I immediately opposed it. Whether it was carried out
or not, I do not know. Field Marshal Paulus, no doubt, is correct
when he said that he had already prevented in his army the
execution of this order. At any rate, I made it my business to have
the order as such rescinded, and I achieved this. The 6th Army,
at my advice, gave certain information to the High Command of
the Wehrmacht or to the Armed Forces Operations Staff. I am
convinced, moreover, that many army leaders acted in the same
way as the leader of the 6th Army and simply did not carry out the
order. At any rate, it was expressly rescinded afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Prosecution quotes two paragraphs from your
radio speech of 5 July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, that is in the English record of Captain Sprecher,
Pages 32 and 33.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution concludes from this
presentation that you had agitated for ruthless measures against
the population of the Soviet Union. You are said to have vilified
the people of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We cannot find it here. What is the PS
number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: It is in the transcript, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have not got the transcript here. We have
the document book. The document book does not contain 32 and 33
pages. It contains only 32 or 31 and a little bit...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I can give the document number which is 3064-PS,
Exhibit USA-723 and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is Page 14 in our book. Well, did you say
5 July?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: 5 July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have got the 7th and 10th of July
but not the 5th. What page in the shorthand notes was it? You
know it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: On Page 32, Page 33 in the English transcript. I
have the English transcript here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you had better read it then.
<span class='pageno' title='161' id='Page_161'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: This quotation from Captain Sprecher’s speech for
the Prosecution reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Letters from the front, film reporters, propaganda companies
attached to the German Army wherever it advanced, P. K.
reporters, and soldiers on leave confirm: In this battle in the
East it is not one ideology fighting against another, not one
political system against another, but culture, civilization, and
human dignity have revolted against devilish principles of
an underworld.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I should like to state the following: With this
statement I was neither calling for ruthless measures against the
population of the Soviet Union, nor did I want to vilify the people
of the Soviet Union. I refer to the full text of the speech of 5 July.
I do not wish to read this speech, but I should like permission to
sum it up briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, in my Document Book 1—I do not
know whether the Tribunal already has it—I have all the radio
speeches...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, we haven’t got it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I have all these radio speeches of the Defendant
Fritzsche from which the Prosecution quoted passages against him
in my document book in their full text.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It has just been handed up to me. What
page is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Pages 8 to 13, the radio speech of 5 July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Will you continue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I ask for permission to sum up the contents very
briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I spoke of the reports which the German public received about
what German soldiers had seen in their advance in the Soviet
Union, especially in connection with prisoners in the prisons in
various cities. I did not describe these things once more; I only
recalled them from the reports which had been given out at the
time. From them I drew the conclusion that now one saw how
necessary the fight was against a system under which such
atrocities were possible. For the peoples of the Soviet Union I
expressly used words of compassion and sympathy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In the same connection, and with the same tendency,
the Prosecution then quotes a sentence from a paragraph of your
radio speech of 10 July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, that is in Document Book 1—the speech of
10 July 1941—also in its full text, on Pages 14 to 19.
<span class='pageno' title='162' id='Page_162'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] What do you have to say to this
charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: What I just said becomes even clearer in this
quotation, and in this whole speech. I referred once more to the
reports just mentioned. I also referred to the descriptions coming
from foreign correspondents. I then quite frankly reported Moscow’s
attitude toward these events and I said, quite honestly,
“Radio Moscow says that these atrocities are facts, but it maintains
that these atrocities were not committed by Russians but by Germans.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of this attitude of Moscow, I, so to speak, took the public
into my confidence. I called upon millions of German soldiers as
witnesses; I called upon their mothers and fathers and wives as
witnesses. I formally called as witnesses the inhabitants of the
occupied territories in which Germans were in power at the time,
and in which, as I said, they were subordinated only to the moral
laws in their own breasts. Then I drew the conclusion: These German
soldiers cannot have committed the atrocities which were
described by Berlin and Moscow in the same way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution asserted that this attempt to ascribe German
atrocities to the Russians was ridiculous. I do not consider it
ridiculous; I consider it tragic. It shows clearly, as I understand it,
the absolute cleanliness and honesty of the whole German conduct
of the war. I still believe today that murder and violence and
Sonderkommandos only clung like a foreign body, like a boil, to the
morally sound body of the German people and their Armed Forces.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Finally, the Prosecution quotes a passage from your
speech of 9 October 1941, another quotation from which was brought
out elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this is in the Fritzsche Document Book Number 1;
the speech in its full text is on Pages 20 to 25. The quotations of the
Prosecution are summed up in a document in the Fritzsche document
book of the Prosecution. I think the Tribunal can easily
compare it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution concludes from this
quotation that you had approved of the policy of the Nazi conspirators
in their ruthless exploitation of the occupied territories.
What have you to say to that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: There is no question of ruthlessness either in the
quotation given by the Prosecution or in the rest of the text of the
speech of 9 October 1941. I refer to my affidavit 3469-PS, Paragraph
39, a paragraph which the Prosecution very fairly quoted in
this connection.
<span class='pageno' title='163' id='Page_163'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In addition, may I once more sum up, very briefly, the sense of
this speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was the time when German soldiers were stationed from
the Black Sea to the Bay of Biscay. I spoke of the possibility of
exploiting the resources of this enormous territory. I said, “The
possibilities of this continent are so considerable that they can cover
any need for war and for peace.” I said, in this connection, that a
starving-out by blockade, such as was attempted in 1914-18, was
now out of the question. I spoke of the possibilities of the organization
of Europe which could begin in the midst of the war...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In the midst of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: ...in the midst of war, and I meant the organization
of European nations with equal rights. It is beyond all doubt
that at that time I was not thinking of ruthless exploitation of the
occupied territories, but only of winning them over politically and
economically after the storms of war had blown by.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I now come to another subject, so
perhaps this would be a good time to break off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I have a request, Mr. President. I would like to
have my client excused for the rest of the day because I want to
talk to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What did you know about the removal of Jews from
occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I did not know anything of their removal, but I
heard that certain individuals were being arrested, Jews and non-Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What did you know about the topic, which we
discussed here, of slave labor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I knew that millions of foreign workers were
working in the Reich. I did not consider them slaves, for I saw them
daily walking about free on the streets of all the cities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What did you know about their treatment, about
their living conditions, and their wages?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Reports about these things were sent to me or to
my co-workers from the office of Sauckel and the German Labor
Front. From these reports, among other things, I remember the
fact that the foreign workers were given the same treatment as
<span class='pageno' title='164' id='Page_164'></span>
the German workers in every respect. I further recall having
heard that the initial inferior treatment accorded to Eastern Workers
had been done away with. I received many reports from
listeners complaining about the fact that foreign workers were
allegedly in better position than German workers; and in this connection,
I remember a reference to the fact that the foreign workers
were permitted to send home money in the form of foreign
exchange.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also talked with foreign workers many times. I did not hear
any special complaints. On the other hand, in the Propaganda
Ministry, through official channels, I heard a great deal about the
care given to foreign workers even along cultural lines. Frequently
I was approached by Sauckel or the German Labor Front—I do not
remember which it was—with the request to have radio broadcasts
sent to one or another group of foreign workers. I was approached
also with the request for turning over receiving sets to camps of
foreign workers, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you know that most of them did not come to
Germany voluntarily?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That was exactly what I did not know. Here in
this proceeding it was mentioned that Sauckel in one meeting or
another made a statement about the fact that only a small percentage
had come voluntarily. That was unknown to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I did hear the following complaints: First of all, that extravagant
promises were made at the time of recruitment of the foreign
workers, which could not be kept afterward. In the interest of my
propaganda I had objections raised against that through the
propaganda department of my Ministry when I heard about it. Then,
I remember having heard complaints from Poland dealing with the
fact that employers were “pirating” Polish workers from one
another.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Sauckel testified that in this connection he co-operated
with the Propaganda Ministry and that he had many discussions
with the Propaganda Ministry. Did you participate in such
discussions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I did not participate in these conferences. I
thought that I met Sauckel here for the first time. He reminded
me of our meeting in the spring of 1945 at the home of Dr. Goebbels
when some evening gathering took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you have anything to do with the propaganda
used in the recruitment of foreign workers in occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What did you have to do with the propaganda which
was disseminated in the occupied countries?
<span class='pageno' title='165' id='Page_165'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: This propaganda, as it applied to occupied countries,
was not subordinate to me, not even in the branches of the
press or radio. This propaganda was under the direction and supervision
of the local Reich commissioner, military commander,
or governor. However, I did exert influence on this propaganda
in the occupied countries on two, three, or four occasions when this
propaganda in the occupied countries was contrary to the directives
which applied to the Reich. I usually gathered this from the echo
abroad. I remember one special case which received general attention.
A certain man by the name of Friedrich attacked the Pope
over the German radio in Paris. I had this man Friedrich replaced.
That was the extent of my influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Goebbels, however, exerted much more influence on the
propaganda in the occupied countries, especially through his foreign
section or his Foreign Press Department or through his liaison
officer to the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you not make any radio broadcasts in the
occupied countries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, broadcasts of two types. An example of the
first type is as follows: At the time of the occupation, Radio Paris
was under German influence. Despite that, I retained the old German
broadcast in the French language via Radio Stuttgart. I
wanted to have it understood quite specifically that the occupation
was an abnormal and a temporary situation, and anything that
was taking place during the period of occupation did not have
anything to do with that part of, let us say, German-French conversations,
which was being carried on by the two mother
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second example is as follows: It concerns German broadcasts
in the Spanish and Portuguese languages. I had them transmitted
through three stations in southern France, for it was easier
to receive these transmissions in the Pyrenees peninsula. The basis
for my work in this connection was a contract which we had
with these stations and the payment of regular charges. Negotiations
for this contract were carried out through the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I shall now turn to a different topic. You are
accused of making anti-Semitic statements. Were you anti-Semitic,
and in what way did you participate in anti-Semitic propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I was not anti-Semitic in the idea of a noisy anti-Semitism.
The Prosecution has asserted that all defendants—that
is, including myself—had shouted, “Germany awake and Judaism
shall die.” I will state under oath that I never raised this cry or
one similar. I was not anti-Semitic in the sense of either the
<span class='pageno' title='166' id='Page_166'></span>
radical theories or methods beginning with Theodor Fritsch to
Julius Streicher.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has stated that even the Defendant Streicher,
the main anti-Jewish agitator of all times, could hardly have
excelled Fritzsche when it came to libels against the Jews. I protest
against this statement. I do not believe that I deserve any
such accusation. Never did I give out any propaganda dealing
with ritual murders, cabala, and the so-called secrets of the Elders
of Zion. At all times of my life I considered them machinations
of a rather primitive agitation. For humanitarian reasons, I regret
that I have to make a further statement, but I cannot refrain from
making this statement in the interests of truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My co-workers and I, in the press and on the radio, without
exception I would say, rejected <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> radically. I personally,
during a period of 13 years of regular newspaper comments,
never quoted this paper. <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> was not quoted in the German
press either. The editors did not belong to the journalists’
union and the publisher did not belong to the publishers’ organization
during my term of office. How things were later on, I do
not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As I have already stated in my affidavit, I tried twice to ban
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. However, I did not succeed. Then it was proposed
that I censor <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. However, I declined the offer. I wanted
to prohibit the publishing of <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, not just because the
mere verbatim reproduction of a page of the newspaper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
was the most effective anti-German propaganda which ever existed,
but I wanted to ban <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> simply for reasons of good taste.
I wanted to prohibit it as a source of radicalism against which I
fought wherever I met it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The great secret for the sudden increase in the circulation of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> after 1933 to half a million, already referred to in
this Court, lay in the same cause as the secret of the sudden increase
of such organizations as the SA.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party in 1933 had blocked the influx of new members, and
a great many people tried to get in somehow, if not directly with
the Party, then with some organization connected with the Party,
such as, perhaps, the SA. Or they tried to show sympathy with
National Socialist ideas by subscribing to <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> and displaying
it. Therefore, in that sense, I was not anti-Semitic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I was anti-Semitic in this sense: I wanted a restriction
of the predominant influence of Jewry in German politics, economy,
and culture, such as was manifested after the first World War.
I wanted a restriction based on the ratio of Jews to Germans.
I proclaimed publicly this view of mine on occasions, but I did
not exploit these views in extensive systematic propaganda.
<span class='pageno' title='167' id='Page_167'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Those anti-Semitic statements with which I am charged by the
Prosecution have a different connection. The facts are as follows:
After the outbreak of the war I referred frequently to the fact
that Jewish emigrants immediately after 1933, were the first ones
to emphasize that a war against the National Socialist German
State was necessary; for instance, Emil Ludwig or George Bernhard
or the <span class='it'>Pariser Tageblatt</span>. As far as I recall, this was the only connection
in which I made anti-Semitic statements of any kind. I
cannot say this without asking to be permitted to emphasize one
more point. Only in these proceedings here did I learn that in the
autumn of 1939 there was more at stake than just one city and
a road through the Corridor; that in truth and in fact, a new
partition of Poland had already been prepared at least, and only
here in these proceedings did I learn that Hitler had confirmed
in a dreadful manner the warnings of the Jews against him by
an order to murder them. If I had known both of these things at
that time, then I would have pictured the role of Jewish propaganda
before the outbreak of the war quite differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, in this connection I should like to
refer to the document which has already been submitted, Document
Number Fritzsche-2, the affidavit by Dr. Scharping, with reference
to Pages 9 to 11. This document is found in my Document Book
Number 2; however, I do not know whether this document book
has been submitted to the High Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, it has.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Pages 9 to 11. I refer to the contents of this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution has quoted a passage
from the book by Müller, dealing with the Propaganda
Ministry. According to this, among other things, it was the task
of this Ministry to enlighten the population about the Jewish question.
According to the picture drawn by the Prosecution, matters
stood as though you were the one charged with the task of this
enlightenment; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. The “Jewry” department was a branch of the
propaganda department which carried on this so-called active
propaganda in opposition to the specialized or administrative
departments. I never directed this department of propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I should like to interpolate a question. The Defendant
Streicher, on 29 April, stated that the Propaganda Ministry
published a <span class='it'>National Socialist Correspondence</span> which was sent to
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> as well and which contained in each issue several anti-Semitic
articles. Is that true?
<span class='pageno' title='168' id='Page_168'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. The <span class='it'>National Socialist Correspondence</span> was
not published by the Propaganda Ministry, but by the Reichspressestelle
(Reich Press Office) of the NSDAP; however, I did not have
the impression that the particular policy followed by <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
took its character from these articles. On the other hand, <span class='it'>Der
Stürmer</span> may have published one or the other article which was
given out by the NSK.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Prosecution quoted a passage from a speech
which you made over the radio on 18 December 1941. This speech
will be found in full in my Document Book Number 1, Pages 26
to 32. In this instance, you said that the fate of Jewry in Europe
had been rather unpleasant and that this fate in all probability
would stretch over to the New World as well. The Prosecution
holds the view that this was a proclamation of further actions in
the persecution of Jews. What can you tell us about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In this quotation, I discussed the unpleasant fate
of Jewry in Europe. According to the things that we know today,
this must appear as though I meant the murder of the Jews. But
in this connection, I should like to state that at that time I did not
know about these murders; therefore I could not have meant it.
I did not even mean the evacuation of Jews, for even this was not
carried out in Berlin at least until a year or two later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What I meant was simply the elimination of Jews from politics
and economic life. The expression “unpleasant” hints at this; otherwise
the inoffensiveness of this term could not be explained. And
now to the question of why I spoke about the Jews in America in
this connection. The sentence quoted by the Prosecution is inextricably
connected with a communication preceding it, stating
that a Jewish National Council had submitted to President Roosevelt
their wish to enter the war. Not even this association of ideas,
which is perhaps understandable now, was used by me without
good reason. The largest part of the speech in question, perhaps
nine-tenths of it, in fact, deals with the investigation commission
set up in the United States to investigate the causes of Pearl Harbor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There are a lot of pages in this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Document Book Number 1, Mr. President, Pages 26
to 32.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes; I wanted to know whether first of all
we are on Page 31.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: He is referring in his statements which he is making
now to the entire contents of the speech, Mr. President. The Prosecution
had quoted only the very last paragraph of this speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.]</span> Please continue.
<span class='pageno' title='169' id='Page_169'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In this polemic address I not only suggested investigating
whether the guards of the U. S. Navy had been careless
but I also advised checking into American politics, as to whether
someone might not have been interested in the outbreak of the war.
In this connection, I recalled that an investigating committee of
the American Senate, 20 years after the first World War, had investigated
the causes for entry of the United States in the war
in 1917. I said verbatim, “This Senate committee proved that Wilson,
when entering the war, knew that he was the victim of a
few warmongers.” I deplored...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The investigation committee of the Americans
about the entry into the last war? Isn’t he going rather far
back?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I believe that the defendant can stop
at this point. He only wanted to show that the quotation of the last
paragraph cited by the Prosecution in order to incriminate him was,
torn from its contents. That is the fact he wanted to show, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The second quotation used by the
Prosecution is an excerpt from your radio speech of 18 March 1941.
The Prosecution was of the opinion that this was also an incitement
for the persecution of Jews, and they said, further, that it was
proof of your propaganda with the term “master race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this speech of 18 March 1941 may be found in
my Document Book Number 1, Pages 2 to 7.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution quoted only one
paragraph from this speech. What can you tell us in this connection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not wish to read this quotation. I rather ask
that you read it carefully yourself, and after you have read
it you will see that I completely agreed with Mr. Roosevelt when
he said that there was no master race. I endorsed the correctness
of this sentence not only as it applied to the German people, but
to Jewry as well. The Prosecution concluded from this sentence
that it was a justification for acts committed in Jewish persecutions
in the past and that it was a foreboding of more persecutions to
come. I do not understand this conclusion; it has no basis whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In our copy there is no date at the top of
Page 2 of your Volume I—yes, I see it is in the index. Which page
of it is the passage that the Prosecution quotes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: On Page 5 under Point 5, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Very well.
<span class='pageno' title='170' id='Page_170'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: It begins with the words, “But the crown...” and
so forth. That is the quotation used by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The third quotation used by the
Prosecution is a passage from the speech which you made on 9 October
1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, the whole speech is to be found in Document Book
Number 1, Pages 20 to 25.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] The Prosecution quoted only one
paragraph from this speech as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this paragraph, you, Herr Fritzsche, are speaking about a
new wave of international Jewish-democratic-bolshevistic agitation.
What can you tell us about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I have very little to say in this connection. This
speech was made in those days of the autumn of 1941 when the
Reich Press Chief had announced that German victory in the East
had been decisive. I had warned the entire German press about
taking this slogan without reservations. I did not believe in this
decision which supposedly had already taken place. I suggested
to all German newspapers that they speak about a prolonged
duration of the war. In this speech of mine I wanted to weaken
the impression of the official victory bulletin. Therefore, in this
speech, and perhaps for the first time in Germany, I mentioned
those three factors which, in fact, later on determined the war in
the East against Germany: First of all, the partisans; secondly, the
international help in the way of arms and munitions; and thirdly,
propaganda. This last part alone was quoted by the Prosecution.
As I have already said, this last part is quite in accord with the
knowledge and opinion I held at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The next quotation used by the Prosecution is an
extract from a speech which you made on 8 January 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The complete speech, Mr. President, may be found in my Document
Book Number 1. It is speech Number 7, to be found on
Pages 40 to 45.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] In this speech you are stating that
it was not a new form of government or a new form of socialism
which had brought about the war, but rather the agitation of Jews
and plutocrats was responsible for this. How did you come to make
that statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: To justify it, I should like to refer here, too, to
everything that I have already said, and beyond that, I should like
to emphasize that this rather heated accusation was not made by
me just out of the blue or just because I wanted to agitate. This
is proven by the context.
<span class='pageno' title='171' id='Page_171'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If I may be permitted to do so, I should like to state briefly the
connection in this case. The topic of this speech was the differences
of opinion which existed at that time between the Polish Exile
Government in Moscow—rather, in London—and the Soviet Government
in Moscow. There was a matter of territorial demands which
they disagreed on, and on this occasion I quoted the London <span class='it'>Times</span>
word for word. The London <span class='it'>Times</span> said that “the relinquishing
of Polish regions, as demanded by Russia, was only a small and
modest price for the absolute and reliable guarantee to Poland of
help through the Soviet Union.” This statement made by the London
Times I used as a matter of course in a polemic statement in which
I said, “Well, if the <span class='it'>Times</span> had written in such a strain in August
of 1939, that it was only about a city or a road, then surely there
would not have been any war,” and so forth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On this occasion I should like to state that all of these quotations,
almost without exception, show only the combination of the
concept Jew, Plutocrat, Bolshevik. The question of race was not
the primary one, but the thing that was primary was the ideological
struggle as it seemed, to my mind, to be taking place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The next quotations used by the Prosecution are
some excerpts from your speech of 13 January 1945.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this is speech Number 8, contained in full in
Document Book Number 1, to be found on Pages 46 to 51. The
Prosecution in this case is quoting only two paragraphs, one on
Page 50 of my document book, Paragraph 2.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] In these passages you mention Jewish
influence on British policies. How could you make those statements?
What were your reasons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The Prosecution assumes from this quotation that
it was the introduction to further persecution of the Jews and to
their complete extermination. This conclusion, however, is justified
neither in the words nor in the sense nor when seen in the
light of the context...</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall forego giving you in this case a picture of the connections,
not even in a brief summary. It can be gathered when you read
the speech in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, I cannot see where an appeal for the extermination of
the Jews is to be found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Forming a part of the general crimes against
humanity you are accused of incitive libel against the Jews, the
logical result of which is said to have been further persecutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I want to ask you about the murder of Jews. Did
you know of Hitler’s decree, as testified by the witness Hoess, a
decree according to which the Jews were to be murdered?
<span class='pageno' title='172' id='Page_172'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I should like to state under my oath that I did
not know of this order by Hitler. If I had known it, I would not
have served that person who had given this order for another hour.
I should like to state further that evidently this decree, as well as
this entire action, was concealed with specific care from me and
my co-workers, because once I almost discovered its existence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you receive at any time an indication about the
killing of a large number of innocent people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. In February or March 1942 I received a letter
from a medium-ranking SS leader of the Ukraine. I do not
recall this man’s name. The contents of the letter were to the
effect that the author was the commander of an SS unit, that he
had received an order to kill the Jews and the Ukrainian intelligentsia
of his area. Upon receipt of this order, he had suffered a
nervous breakdown and he was now in a hospital. It seemed to him
that a complaint along official channels was quite impossible for
him. He said he did not know me but had confidence in me; perhaps
I could help in some way. He asked me not to mention his
name as he was bound to silence at the cost of his life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Without much hesitation and immediately upon receipt of this
letter I called Heydrich, the Obergruppenführer, then leader of the
RSHA or the Gestapo. I hardly knew him personally, but he
declared himself quite willing to receive me immediately. I visited
him and asked him pointblank, “Is your SS there for the purpose
of committing mass murders?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Heydrich was quite indignant at this question, and said that
larger or smaller SS units had been assigned by him for police
purposes to various ministers, Reich commissioners, and so forth.
These special details of SS men had been misused on various occasions,
and he thought this might apply to the unit which had been
placed at the disposal of Gauleiter Koch. He told me that he would
have an investigation started immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Next noon he called me, from headquarters as he said, and let
me know that this action had actually been attempted on the order
of Koch. Koch, for his part, had referred to the Führer. The Führer,
however, had not answered as yet. Heydrich said I would receive
further details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two days later Heydrich asked me to come and visit him and
said Hitler had expressly declared that he had not given this order;
Koch now said that there was a misunderstanding. I was further
told that an investigation of Koch had been started. At any rate,
Heydrich promised me that this action would not be carried through.
I remember particularly well one sentence which was used in this
discussion, words used by Heydrich: “Believe me, Herr Fritzsche,
<span class='pageno' title='173' id='Page_173'></span>
anyone who has the reputation of being cruel does not have to be
cruel; he can act humanely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shortly thereafter, I was made a soldier and asked to be sent
to the 6th Army and was sent to the Ukraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. I did not understand that
last sentence. Heydrich said, “Believe me, Herr Fritzsche...” and
then...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: May I repeat: “...anyone who has the reputation
of being cruel does not have to be cruel; he can act humanely.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but then you went on about going to
the 6th Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, shortly thereafter I became a soldier...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: He added, Mr. President, that shortly after this
meeting with Heydrich, he himself, that is the Defendant Fritzsche,
became a soldier and he specifically asked to be detailed to the
6th Army which at that time was stationed in the Ukraine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was the date of this incident?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: February-March 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: When you were a soldier in the Ukraine, did you
try to check the statements of Heydrich as to their correctness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I had no official authority to do this, but as an
old journalist I made investigations on my own, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, I investigated in Kiev, with the local German radio
station. The answer was: Yes, several shootings actually did take
place, specifically after the blowing up of certain blocks of houses
in Kiev, on which occasion many German soldiers lost their lives.
However, they were shootings according to sentences imposed by
courts-martial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, for 3 days I traveled in all directions between Kiev and
Poltava. Mostly I traveled alone. I found the population in utmost
peace; there were no signs of terror whatsoever, and by the way,
I was received very well myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Poltava I checked with officers and soldiers. On these
occasions as well, I was told, “Yes, there were some court-martial
sentences. The reason for these sentences was sabotage.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in Kharkov itself, I visited the SS command stationed
there, and I spoke with the Sturmführer Rexlach. He denied any
shooting actions. He showed me the prison and there were perhaps
50 inmates, no more. I asked him about camps and he stated
that there were none.
<span class='pageno' title='174' id='Page_174'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I visited a Ukrainian family; I questioned a German agricultural
leader at Bielgorod, and I met with the same result in
every case: no shooting actions took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I certainly assumed from that that it had been an attempted
individual action which had not been carried through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Before this letter which the SS leader had sent you,
did you not already have suspicions, perhaps from Allied radio
broadcasts to which you had access?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: These radio broadcasts were accessible to me. I
had reports on atrocities specially gathered at that time and selected
from the great number of enemy broadcasts which we received
every day, and then I had these reports investigated and checked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And who concerned himself with this checking?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The competent specialist, Oberregierungsrat Körber,
in charge of the Schnelldienst office of the Press Department,
or one of his co-workers, or I myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Where was this checked?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: We inquired of the RSHA, for in most of these
reports of atrocities the SS or Gestapo were mentioned as the ones
who had perpetrated the murders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: At which of the many branches of this office did
you inquire?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: We inquired at the various competent offices, and
I do not doubt that we inquired of Eichmann, who has been mentioned
in these proceedings here. Apart from that, we inquired of
Sturmbannführer Spengler or his deputy Von Kielpinsky, both of
them members of that office which, at that time or later, was taken
over by Ohlendorf who has also appeared here as a witness.
Frequently we inquired of the branch offices of the Reichssicherheitshauptamt,
the so-called state police control offices as well,
especially if there were reports from a special area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What were the answers you received?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: We always received the answer that the report in
question was either completely wrong and was an invention, or that
the report had this or that legal basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Frequently figures and details were reported which in effect were
quite disarming.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Are there any records of this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. The more important questions and answers
were noted and were even reproduced and sent to the various offices
within and outside the Propaganda Ministry. All the material was
<span class='pageno' title='175' id='Page_175'></span>
collected in the archives called “Schnelldienst,” for which I applied
here and which was granted to me but not found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And you just believed these answers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I did believe them, for after all this was
information which was given to me by official sources and furthermore
I had experienced on numerous occasions that the authenticity
of such reports from these sources had been proved very drastically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What do you mean by that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Perhaps I might give you an example. The first
propaganda action of the war was the report given out by Warsaw
about the destruction of the picture of the “Black Madonna” of
Czestochowa. This report was transmitted around the world. We
took German and foreign journalists to Czestochowa, who could
assure themselves that this report was not true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But I must be quite honest here and say that I really wanted to
cite another example in reply to this question put by my counsel,
another report which really had its surprising after-effects for me
in this courtroom some 2 or 3 days ago. The British newspaper
<span class='it'>News Chronicle</span>, on 24 September 1939, printed the report
that the German...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the evidential value of the <span class='it'>News
Chronicle</span> in 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The defendant wants to prove to the High Tribunal
that he found that many reports from abroad, dealing with German
atrocities, actually were false, so that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, we do not need details about that. No
doubt there were frequent reports which were not accurate. We do
not want you to go into details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I wanted to prove with just one news item how
at that time something which the world believed could be denied
and then, in the shadow of this denial, quite unnoticed by the German
public, something did take place, such as a larger wave of
arrests or a similar matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He can state the facts, but he need not go
into detail about a particular issue of the newspaper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Was it only once, Herr Fritzsche, that you learned
of the falsehood of such foreign broadcasts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, that took place quite frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Please be very brief, Herr Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: One of my co-workers gathered the necessary
material for an article entitled, “In 8 Weeks of War 107 Lies.” I
should like to say only one thing about this. The compilation of
<span class='pageno' title='176' id='Page_176'></span>
such false reports given out by our enemy gave me a sense of
moral superiority over that type of reporting, and this feeling was
the basis of my later work, which could not be explained without
this feeling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did it not strike you that such false reports occurred
only in the beginning of the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, that thought never occurred to me. The reports
were so numerous in the beginning and I could also notice them
in later years. Some affected me personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How far did they affect you personally? Can you
sketch it in a few brief words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Just one of many statements: An enemy front
propaganda bulletin accused me of the fact that 600,000 Swedish
kroner...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is he going to now? What is the purpose
of this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: He wants to give an example of how a false statement
applied to him personally. He wanted to state that briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, as I said already, there were, no doubt,
erroneous statements made in the foreign press and every press.
We cannot investigate those sorts of matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Then I shall pass on to another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Did you not, as an experienced journalist
in the news service, have the feeling that where there is
smoke there is fire? Did you not believe that at least something
must be true of the enemy reports about murders and so forth in
the areas under German domination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Precisely because I was a professional newsman
I did not have this feeling. Again and again I thought—and I
repeatedly reminded the public—of one erroneous bit of reporting
of the first World War. I beg the Tribunal to grant me permission
to mention it quite briefly because it is also a part of the fundamentals
of the propaganda which I carried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I have already pointed out that we
assume that there are a variety of errors. We do not want to go
into detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Then I shall turn to another question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] But surely you knew that the Jews
had been evacuated from the Reich; you must have noticed that
they disappeared from the streets?
<span class='pageno' title='177' id='Page_177'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I did notice that even though this occurred
very gradually. Beyond that I heard Dr. Goebbels say on the occasion
of a ministerial conference that as Gauleiter in Berlin he had
demanded the evacuation of Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Where were these Jews taken in your opinion and
what were you told about these things?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Dr. Goebbels told me that they were taken to
reservations in Poland. The suspicion that they were taken to concentration
camps, or that they were even being murdered, never
arose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you inquire about these reservations into which
the Jews were allegedly being taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course I did that. For instance, I learned of
various things from a former co-worker of mine who had been
transferred into the administration of the Government General and
who had an administrative position in the region Biala-Podlaska.
He said that the area under his control had become a Jewish area,
and he repeatedly pictured the arrival and the housing of these
transportees. He also mentioned the difficulties and the employment
of Jews as workers or on plantations. His entire description
bore witness to his humane point of view. He told me that under
him the Jews fared better than they had in the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What was the name of this man?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Oberregierungsrat Hubert Kühl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you hear unfavorable reports about these
deported Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. Sturmbannführer Radke of the staff of the
Reichsführer SS reported, perhaps in the winter of 1942, that the
mortality rate of the Jews in the eastern ghettos was abnormally
high due to the changeover from mental work to manual labor. He
mentioned there were even some isolated cases of typhus.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that, Dr. Tauber, who was head of the section dealing
with Jewish questions in the propaganda department, told me in
1941, if I remember correctly, that there had been pogroms during
the occupation of Lvov and Kovno, but they were carried out by
the local population. He assured me at the same time that the
German authorities had taken steps against these pogroms. Nevertheless
the references to such things caused me to criticize matters
severely, even though these things today look almost insignificant
compared with what we know of today. My criticism was directed
against my superiors, particularly Dr. Goebbels, and also against co-workers
and members of the Gestapo and of the Party. I referred
repeatedly to the legal, political, and moral necessity of protecting
these Jews, who, after all, had been entrusted to our care.
<span class='pageno' title='178' id='Page_178'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you learn anything else about the fate of these
Jews?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: On several occasions Jews or relatives or friends
of Jews appealed to me because of discrimination or arrests. A large
number of non-Jews also did this as my name had become well-known
to the public. Without exception, I made their pleas my
own and I tried to help through various offices such as the RSHA,
through the personnel section of my Ministry, through individual
ministers and Gauleiter, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Why did you turn to so many different authorities
and offices?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Very many requests were involved, and if my
name had appeared too often at the same office its effectiveness
would have been exhausted very quickly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you on occasion turn down these requests?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, not in one single instance, and I should like
to emphasize that particularly because a letter addressed to me in
this prison here was not handed over to me but was published in
the press. It was a letter in which a woman asserted that I had
turned down a request for pardon. I remember this case specifically
and I should like to emphasize briefly that in this case I had expressly
called on the Reich Minister of Justice...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is sufficient for him to say that he did not
turn them down. We do not want one instance of somebody who
wrote to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How long are you going to be, Dr. Fritz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I believe I shall be able to conclude the entire
Fritzsche case tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I have heard that there is no open session this
afternoon...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: ...otherwise I would have been able to conclude
the entire Fritzsche case today. However, I hope to be able to conclude
my examination of the defendant in his own case and that
of the witness Von Schirmeister. I hope that tomorrow noon I shall
be able to conclude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal hopes so too, because, as I have
pointed out to you, we do not want you to go into such elaborate
detail. You have been going, in the opinion of the Tribunal, far too
much into detail, and we want the matter dealt with more generally.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 28 June 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='179' id='Page_179'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SIXTH DAY</span><br/> Friday, 28 June 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Fritzsche resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Bench, the Defendant
Fritzsche, toward the end of yesterday morning’s session, testified
as to how he tried to aid persecuted persons, within the scope of his
limited opportunities. In order to conclude this subject, and with
the approval of the Prosecution, I submit Document Number
Fritzsche-6, an affidavit of Count Westarp, which is to be found in
my Document Book Number 2 on Pages 23 to 25, dated 15 June
1946. I beg the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the contents of
this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, as another piece of evidence, I should like to offer
another affidavit, made by a Frau Krüger, Berlin, which is to be
Document Number Fritzsche-8. This affidavit has not yet been
included in my document book. However, the original was made
by Frau Krüger in German as well as in English and both copies
have been affirmed and sworn to. I should like to refer to the
contents of this affidavit, especially to the last two paragraphs. From
the last paragraph but one we can see that apart from individual
cases Frau Krüger has a general knowledge of the defendant’s
activities. And the last paragraph is quite interesting; it deals with
the manner of life led by the Defendant Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Apart from that, I also refer here to the entire contents of this
article and I ask the High Tribunal to take judicial notice of this
document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in this connection, I should like to refer to an affidavit
made by Dr. Scharping which has been frequently quoted, Document
Number Fritzsche-2, which is to be found in the Fritzsche Document
Book Number 2, Pages 6 to 15. I refer particularly to Page 13 at
the bottom of the page, and the top of Page 14.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Fritzsche, I should like to put two more general questions
to you on this topic. During the last period of the war, did you not
try to find out something about the final fate of the Jews?
<span class='pageno' title='180' id='Page_180'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. I made the most of an opportunity to which
I will refer briefly later on. I asked a colleague of Obergruppenführer
Glücks, in Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen, about the Jews.
Briefly summarized, his answer was as follows: The Jews were
under the special protection of the Reichsführer SS who wished to
make a political deal with them. He looked upon them as a kind of
hostages and he did not wish a single hair from their heads to be
harmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Some of the Prosecution’s Witnesses have asserted
during this Trial that the German public knew about these murders.
Now I just want to ask you, as a journalist who worked in the
National Socialist State, what was, as far as you know, the attitude
of the broad mass of the German people to the Jews? Did the people
know about the murder of the Jews? Please be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Leaving out all those matters which have already
been mentioned at this Trial, I should like to mention only a few
observations which to me seem important. I shall omit the period
shortly after the first World War, which has already been described,
during which certain anti-Semitic feelings were popular in Germany.
I should like to state only that in 1933 at the time of the
Jewish boycott, which was organized by the NSDAP, the sympathies
of the German people clearly turned again in favor of the Jews.
For a number of years the Party tried hard to prevent the public
from buying in Jewish stores. Finally they even had to resort to
threats. A profound and decisive factor in this development was the
promulgating of the Nuremberg Laws. As a result of these the fight
against the Jews was taken for the first time out of the sphere of
pure agitation, that is, the kind of agitation from which one could
remain aloof, and shifted to the field of State Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time a deep feeling of fear ran through the German
people, for now dissension spread even to individual families. At
that time many human tragedies resulted, tragedies which were
obvious to many, probably to everyone, and there was only one
justification for these racial laws. There was only one excuse for
them and one explanation; that was the assertion and the hope:
Well, now that the separation of the two peoples is being carried
out, although painfully, there will at last be an end to the wild and
unbridled agitation; and due to this separation there will be peace
where formerly only unrest reigned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the Jews were forced to wear the emblem of a star and
when, for instance, in Berlin they were prohibited from occupying
seats on streetcars, the German people openly took sides with the
Jews and it happened again and again that Jews were ostentatiously
offered seats. In this connection I heard several declarations by
<span class='pageno' title='181' id='Page_181'></span>
Dr. Goebbels, who was extremely bitter about this undesired effect
of the marking of the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, as a journalist who worked during that period, am firmly convinced
that the German people were unaware of the mass murders
of the Jews and assertions to that effect were considered rumors;
and reports which reached the German people from outside were
officially denied again and again. As these documents are not in my
possession, I cannot quote from memory individual cases of denial;
but one case I do remember with particular clearness. That was the
moment when the Russians, after they recaptured Kharkov, started
legal proceedings during which killing by gas was mentioned for the
first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I ran to Dr. Goebbels with these reports and asked him about the
facts. He stated he would have the matter investigated and would
discuss it with Himmler and with Hitler. The next day he sent me
notice of denial. This denial was not made public; and the reason
stated was that in German legal proceedings it is necessary to state
in a much plainer manner matters that need clarification. However,
Dr. Goebbels explicitly informed me that the gas vans mentioned in
the Russian legal proceeding were pure invention and that there
was no actual proof to support it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not without reason that the people who operated these
vans were put under the ban of strictest secrecy. If the German
people had learned of these mass murders, they would certainly no
longer have supported Hitler. They would probably have sacrificed
5 million for a victory, but never would the German people have
wished to bring about victory by the murder of 5 million people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to state further that this murder decree of Hitler’s
seems to me the end of every race theory, every race philosophy,
every kind of race propaganda, for after this catastrophe any further
advocacy of race theory would be equivalent to approval in theory
of further murder. An ideology in the name of which 5 million
people were murdered is a theory which cannot continue to exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now I shall turn to a different topic. You are accused
by the Prosecution of having incited atrocities, and that the results
of your propaganda covered every phase of the conspiracy, including
abnormal and inhuman treatment and behavior. In this connection
I shall, therefore, have to ask you about the whole question of concentration
camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you know that the concentration camps existed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, the fact of their creation was announced
publicly, I believe in 1933; and the concentration camps were mentioned
later in official communiqués.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What was the purpose of these camps in your opinion
at that time?
<span class='pageno' title='182' id='Page_182'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: As far as I can recollect, the persons to be taken to
these camps were those who could not be restrained from taking an
active part against the new State. It was stated that the reason for
the establishment of these camps was the abnormal internal political
situation prevailing at that time: A weak center party and two
strong extreme parties, one of which had now assumed power. Steps
were taken to put matters on a proper legal basis. Only later was
it mentioned that habitual criminals were also to be brought to the
concentration camps to prevent them from reverting to crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you know anything about the number of concentration
camps which were established in the course of time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Before the war I had heard about three camps.
During the war I suspected there were five to six; and the chart of
a large number of camps which was exhibited here, was quite a
surprise to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you know anything about the number of prisoners
in these camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Nothing definite. At the beginning of the war,
foreign reports mentioned millions of prisoners. At that time,
together with a few journalists, I asked Obergruppenführer Heydrich
to arrange an interview with members of the local and foreign press
in order to discuss the matter. He did so. As far as I can recollect,
he did not give any definite figures; but rather he compared them
with the number of inmates at the prisons and penitentiaries in
former days. This comparison did not seem to be disquieting. That
was in the winter of 1940 or 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you not have any doubts as to the accuracy of
those figures?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Not at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you know anything about the conditions in the
concentration camps? Did you speak to anyone who had ever been
in a concentration camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. Even as early as 1933 or 1934 I spoke to a
journalist who had been interned for a few weeks in the Oranienburg
concentration camp, which was the old Oranienburg camp. He
informed me that he himself had not been tortured but that he had
seen and heard how others had been beaten and how their fingers
had deliberately been squeezed in a door.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you just accept these reports and do nothing
about them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Quite the contrary! I made quite a row. This journalist—I
believe his name was Stolzenberg, as far as I remember—did
not wish to have his name mentioned. I wrote three letters, one
<span class='pageno' title='183' id='Page_183'></span>
to Dr. Goebbels—and he informed me that he would look into the
matter—another letter to Frick as Minister of the Interior, and one
to Göring as Prussian Prime Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Senior officials from both these offices rang me up and told me
that an investigation was being carried out. A short time afterwards,
I heard that this old camp Oranienburg had been dissolved and that
the commander had been sentenced to death. This was a report
given to me by a Herr Von Lützow, who was press reporter for
Diels or Diehl, who at that time was chief of the State Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: After this first successful protest against ill-treatment,
did you receive any further reports about atrocities in concentration
camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. I received no further reports about ill-treatment.
On the contrary, I frequently made individual inquiries of
members of the Gestapo or of the press section of the Reichsführer
SS. All of the individuals whom I asked declared the following:
Beastliness in the concentration camps only occurred in 1933 or at
the beginning of 1934 at the time when these camps were guarded
by members of the SA, who had no profession—that is to say, by
those members of the SA who had the whole day at their disposal,
and some of them were far from being the best type of men. In this
connection I was told further that the 30th of June signified that a
purge had taken place. The 30th of June had removed those Gauleiter
and those SA leaders who had abused their power. They
declared finally that the concentration camps were now being
guarded by the SS, who had engaged professional guards, professional
administrators and officials expert in dealing with criminal
matters, and prison control officials. I was told that this would be
a guarantee against abuses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you inquire about certain individuals who were
in concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course, I inquired about well-known personalities
such as Parson Niemöller or Schuschnigg, also about Leipkins,
Hess’ private secretary who had been arrested; and in each case I
received information which was reassuring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: They, of course, may have been exceptions because
they were well known and were prominent people. Did you not try
to speak to other people who had been in concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. In April of 1942 I met a former official of the
Communist Party, whose name was Reintgen. We had been soldiers
together for 6 months; and therefore he reported quite frankly to
me, without keeping anything back. He said that he had been ill-treated
in 1933, having had lashes on his back, but not afterwards.
This information fully coincided with my observations.
<span class='pageno' title='184' id='Page_184'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you yourself visit concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I have never been inside the compound of a
concentration camp. However, during the winter of 1944-45 I was
frequently in the administration building near the Oranienburg-Sachsenhausen
camp. Apart from that, I spoke to prisoners as often
as I was able to do so, if I happened to see them either on the march
or at work.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: With whom did you speak at Oranienburg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: With a colleague of Obergruppenführer Glücks and
twice also with him personally. They told me that the foreign
reports regarding cruel treatment were false. They said that the
treatment was not only humane but decidedly good, as after all, the
prisoners were valuable laborers. I spoke at some length about the
working hours, for at that time a rather silly decree had been issued
about a general extension of working hours. The attitude taken by
Glücks was very reasonable, namely, that longer working hours
would not necessarily result in greater output. Therefore the
working hours of 8 to 10 hours a day remained as, before. He did
not mention anything about extermination through overwork. That
is something I heard about for the first time in Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And how about your questions which you put to the
prisoners direct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Well, first of all, there was always a guard present,
and quite naturally the prisoners were suspicious; but eventually I
always received positive replies to positive questions. Briefly, the
gist of these replies was always the same, that they had been
unjustly arrested. Their food was really better than in prison and
I frequently heard this phrase: “Well, anyway we are not soldiers
here.” The weapons carried by the guards were only rifles or revolvers;
I did not see any truncheons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you not become more and more suspicious about
these concentration camps, after listening to foreign radio reports?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Not for a long time, for the reasons which I gave
yesterday. Reports from English members of Parliament regarding
the Buchenwald case were first mentioned in April 1945. But this
case is so very recent that for brevity’s sake I do not need to describe
particulars of the incidents that occurred in the Ministry of
Propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How can you explain the fact that crimes and ill-treatment
of the worst kind undoubtedly took place in concentration
camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am on the horns of a frightful dilemma, since
I heard the first reliable reports about these things here in prison.
<span class='pageno' title='185' id='Page_185'></span>
Only a part of these terrible conditions, which were found to exist,
can be explained through the stoppage of traffic and communications
at the end of the war. The rest is more than enough. Obviously,
the decree for the secret murder of masses of people had brutalized
to a terrible extent those people who were entrusted with the
execution of this decree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not know whether this
explanation is of any value to us as evidence. We have already heard
all about this matter. He has given us his explanation as to why he
says he did not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I have but two more questions I
should like to put to the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Fritzsche, it has been said here in Court that conditions in
concentration camps were generally known to the German people.
As a journalist, will you give us your opinion and the reasons on
which it is based?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has he not given us that already?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No, I beg your pardon, Mr. President. He gave his
opinion when it was a question of the ill-treatment and extermination
of Jews, but on the topic of the extermination of Jews,
I asked him...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you are asking him what his opinion
as a journalist was. I do not see that that is of any importance to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I should be grateful if you would
allow me to put the question, as this is my last question but one.
I expect an answer from the defendant, an answer which would
assist the Tribunal in arriving at a judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: On what matter do you want his opinion as
a journalist?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Defendant Fritzsche would like to repeat a few
statements such as some made, for instance, by Dr. Goebbels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: All right, you may ask the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Did you understand the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I believe a confusion has arisen, inasmuch as I do
not wish to quote Dr. Goebbels on this subject but rather in relation
to our last series of questions which seem to me more important
than the question you have just put to me now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In any event, I should like you to give me a brief
answer to my question. Shall I repeat the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Thank you, no. In this connection I should like to
refer briefly to the statements which I already made about the
murders; that there were many rumors but those rumors were
<span class='pageno' title='186' id='Page_186'></span>
denied. Undoubtedly an iron ring of silence surrounded these
terrible events and the only thing I observed in the course of my
work, and which appears to me to be important, is that in the RSHA
and some of its branches there must have existed groups who
worked systematically with the view of concealing these atrocities
by issuing reassuring statements and denials to the offices which
represented the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now I should like to put a last comprehensive
question. In the course of your examination by me, you made statements
about Hitler and his policies which were entirely different
from those you made long ago in your radio broadcasts, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.
Can you tell us briefly the date and the reason for your change of
opinion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I would like to answer this question very precisely.
The first milestone on the road to this realization was not due to the
German defeat, for right or wrong is independent of victory or
defeat. The fact was that Hitler tried to use this defeat for the
extermination of the German people, as Speer has now horribly
confirmed and as I was able to observe during the last phase of the
conflict in Berlin when, through deceit by raising false hopes, boys
of 15, 14, 13, and 12 years of age were equipped with small arms to
fight against tanks and called into battle, boys who otherwise might
have been the hope for future reconstruction. Hitler found escape
in death, leaving behind him the order to keep on fighting. He also
left behind him the official report that he had died in battle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I learned that he had committed suicide; and thus my last public
statement, on 2 May 1945, was to let everybody know of this suicide,
for I wanted to kill a Hitler legend in the bud.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, while in prison, I heard from a fellow prisoner, a German
major named Sforner, that he had been arrested by the Gestapo,
that he had been tortured in order to make him confess, and that in
his presence, his wife had been beaten. That was the second
milestone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third stage concerned another coprisoner, the world-famous
geographer, General Niedermeier, who proved to me that the
reasons given by Hitler for the attack on Russia were false, at least
on one important point. After he had talked with the interpreter,
he could tell me that in the decisive discussion between Molotov and
Ribbentrop in 1941, Molotov had not put forth any new demands
but that, rather, he demanded that the assurances which had been
given in 1939 should be effective. Therefore, a part of the reasons
given—and I stress this point—that our attack on Russia was to
anticipate a Russian attack, was no longer valid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fourth factor was the proof submitted in Court here of the
murder of 5 million Jews. I have already spoken about this matter.
<span class='pageno' title='187' id='Page_187'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I consider it only my duty to testify to still another statement,
a statement which Dr. Goebbels made in my presence on Saturday,
21 April 1945. Dr. Goebbels, who was in a great state of utmost
excitement, speaking about the last decisive break-through of the
Russians near Berlin, said,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After all, the German people did not want it otherwise. The
German people by a great majority decided through a plebiscite
on the withdrawal from the League of Nations and
against a policy of yielding and chose, instead, a policy of
courage and honor; thereby”—concluded Dr. Goebbels—“the
German people themselves chose the war which they have
now lost.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These were the last words which I heard from Dr. Goebbels and
these words are untrue. I declare under oath: Dr. Goebbels had
never previously given such significance to that plebiscite. Never
had he given it that interpretation. The exact opposite was the case.
At the time of this plebiscite, the German people were explicitly
given once again a solemn assurance of the will for peace on the
part of Hitler and his associates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I am convinced that Hitler and at least some of his
colleagues had deliberately lied to the people on decisive points,
right from the beginning of their political career; and, something
that is not so important to history, I personally felt deceived on
these points, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I have no further questions to put to
the Defendant Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do any of the defendants’ counsel wish to ask
any questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, did you ever hear or ascertain, at the
beginning when the concentration camps were being organized, that
in addition to the regular camps other so-called “wildcat camps”
existed which had been established by the SA leaders without the
knowledge of the competent authorities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. I heard nothing about it at that time. I heard
about this distinction in the concentration camps for the first time
here in Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: On the basis of your present-day knowledge, can
you assert whether the abuses which you described occurred in
these “wildcat” concentration camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I can give you a very precise answer to that question.
These abuses about which I learned occurred in the old camp
Oranienburg, a camp situated in the Berliner Strasse. I do not know
to which category that camp belonged. However, these abuses were
<span class='pageno' title='188' id='Page_188'></span>
stopped; and I emphasized in my testimony that, almost immediately
after I sent my letter to the Prussian Prime Minister, I was called
in by a ministerial counsellor or Ministerialdirektor, and I was
assured that an investigation would be made—a promise which was
kept—but in any case I do not remember whether a final report was
sent me from this office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: In June 1934 the publication of Von Papen’s
Marburg speech was forbidden. Is it correct to say that from that
time onward, any statement on the part of the Defendant Von Papen
could be published only with the previous approval of the Ministry
of Propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is correct, and in even a closer sense. Confiscation
of the Marburg speech, as I remember distinctly, was carried
out at the instigation of Berndt, who later became Ministerialdirektor.
This man drew Dr. Goebbels’ attention to the speech. With
regard to any other of Papen’s announcements, the principle was
that not even the Ministry of Propaganda had the right to release
them for publication but, rather, that they had to be forwarded
either to the Minister personally or to the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: In your testimony you mentioned that you
had known the Defendant Von Papen for some time and that you
got to know him when you visited Turkey. Just when did you visit
Turkey?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In January, I believe it was 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: What was the purpose of your visit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I delivered a speech to the German colony in
Istanbul and Ankara on the occasion of the 30th of January.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Did Herr Von Papen have anything to do
with this speech and with this festivity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, less than nothing. I received an official request
from Berlin to see to it that Herr Von Papen would not ostensibly
depart before the celebration of the 30th of January, as he wanted
to do. I did not attempt to persuade Herr Von Papen to stay and so
he left his office in time to go skiing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THEODOR KLEFISCH (Counsel for SA): Witness, you just
now said that it had been reported to you that at the end of the
year 1933 and at the beginning of 1934 unemployed SA men were
guarding certain concentration camps and that abuses were probably
to be traced back to that fact. I have but one question: Who reported
that to you? Who was the author of that report?
<span class='pageno' title='189' id='Page_189'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The then press chief or press expert of Reichsführer
SS Himmler, whose name was Gerhard Ratke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KLEFISCH: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ SAUTER (Counsel for Defendant Funk): Witness, the
day before yesterday you stated that the Defendant Funk was not
concerned with propaganda in the Propaganda Ministry but that in
the main he was concerned with organizational and financial
matters. Now I should like to ask you to answer several questions
regarding the activities of the Defendant Funk in the Propaganda
Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You know, Witness, that at the beginning there was a Press
Department of the Reich Government and that it was a State institution.
How long did this Press Department exist, and what
became of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It had existed for quite some time, at least up
until March 1933, when it was a branch of the Foreign Office. From
then on it became a branch of the Propaganda Ministry, and it had
a dual mission to carry on: First of all to be the Press Department
of this Ministry and secondly, to continue functioning as the Press
Department for the Reich Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Witness, can you tell me who, beginning with
March of 1933—that is, from the incorporation of the Press Department
into the Propaganda Ministry—was the chief of this Press
Department and, for all practical purposes, was the chief of the
press system? Was that Funk or was it someone else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, that was Ministerial Counsellor Jahnke, successor
to Ministerial Director Berndt. This Press Department was
then divided into three sections: German press...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: I am not interested in that, Witness, I am interested
only in knowing whether the chief of this department was the
Defendant Funk or whether it is correct to say that he had nothing
to do with these matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Nominally, of course, he was the chief, but with
the practical operation he had nothing to do. That was taken care
of by Dr. Goebbels, Hahnke, and Jahnke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: And later Berndt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Witness, I have another question. Who had the
management of the press policy in the Propaganda Ministry? I am
still referring to the State organ. Did the Defendant Funk have
anything to do with it, or just who was it? Who directed the press
policy?
<span class='pageno' title='190' id='Page_190'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: At that time Dr. Goebbels himself exercised that
function. Later on it was the Reich Press Chief, Dr. Dietrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: The Defendant Funk was State Secretary in the
Propaganda Ministry, or at least he had the title of State Secretary.
Now, looking at this matter rather generally, I would be interested
in knowing this: Did he, in fact, have the position of a
State Secretary and exercise authority as such, or did another
official exercise the function of State Secretary as the regular deputy
of the Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: As a matter of course, naturally, he had the position,
the power, the prestige, and the salary of a State Secretary;
but the practical work was distributed a little differently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Just how was it handled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I have already mentioned that. Practically, Funk
concerned himself with organization and finance as they applied to
the gigantic cultural concern which was being developed at that
time; whereas the actual policy was set up by Dr. Goebbels with
the chief of his ministerial office, Hahnke, who was the successor
of Funk as State Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: I have one final question, Witness, which refers
to another topic.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you know what Minister Dr. Goebbels, in November of 1938
or later, said about the Jewish pogroms of 9 November 1938, with
regard to Defendant Funk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Much later Dr. Goebbels stated in my presence that
sometimes radical measures would just simply have to be taken, for
instance, when Funk had constantly declared that the Jews could
not be eliminated from economic life; but he, Dr. Goebbels, had to
prove to Funk that it could be done by organizing the riots of
8 November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: In this connection did he say anything about the
fact that this Jewish action, for which Dr. Goebbels was responsible,
was also instigated with the purpose of discrediting Dr. Funk and
confronting him with a <span class='it'>fait accompli</span>? Did he state anything
like that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That was the sense of the answer that I just
gave you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: I have no further questions; Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. WALTER SIEMERS (Counsel for Defendant Raeder): Herr
Fritzsche, in this Court we have heard what grave accusations are
made against the Defendant Raeder because of an article in the
newspaper <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>. The article I refer to is “Churchill
Sinks the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>,” which was published on 23 October 1939.
<span class='pageno' title='191' id='Page_191'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this is Document 3260-PS, or Exhibit GB-218.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to put a few questions pertaining to the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>
case. Herr Fritzsche, when did the Propaganda Ministry receive the
report about the torpedoing of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, and through what
channels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot give you the date from memory, but I do
know that we received this report by wireless; that is, we listened
in to a foreign broadcast.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: This wireless report came in shortly after the
sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Without doubt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Did the Propaganda Ministry get in touch with
the High Command of the Navy in order to learn the details of this
matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I personally did that because I happened to
have a liaison officer from the Navy High Command in my office
for censorship advice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Whom did you get in touch with in the High
Command of the Navy, and what did you learn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: First of all, I spoke to the officer who was with
me, whom I have just mentioned, Kapitänleutnant Hahn. Then he
telephoned, and in all probability I phoned, too, to the OKM (the
High Command of the Navy). As far as I recall, I spoke to Korvettenkapitän
Wolf.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: And what did Korvettenkapitän Wolf tell you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: He told me already at this early stage that no
German U-boat was in the area in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I should like to remind you that the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> was
sunk on 4 September 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What did the Propaganda Ministry do after the High Command
of the Navy had stated that it was not a German U-boat which had
sunk the ship?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Then this report was announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Herr Fritzsche, how did it happen that about 6
to 7 weeks later the article, “Churchill Sinks the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>,” appeared,
which was published on 23 October 1939? Shall I show you the
article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Thank you, no. I remember this incident especially
well, as I have checked my memory about it since this case was
mentioned again for the first time here in the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know that Hitler himself ordered this article to be written,
giving detailed instructions. The order to write the article came
<span class='pageno' title='192' id='Page_192'></span>
through two different channels: First, through a telephone call by
the Reich Press Chief, Dr. Dietrich; and secondly through a telephone
call by Dr. Goebbels or one of his officials—I am not able to
tell you which of the two. This order was to be transmitted to the
<span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we come to the circumstances on account of which I remember
the details. When I told one of my co-workers to inform the
<span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, he came back to me with the report that it
would not be necessary because the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> had
already heard the necessary details directly from the Führer’s
headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: When was this order given by Hitler, or rather,
Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The day before it appeared, I assume.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Did any office in the High Command of the
Navy have any connection with this article?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: According to my knowledge, no.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Before this article was published, did you speak
with Grossadmiral Raeder about this article, or did you advise him
of the order given by Hitler in this direction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I believe that the High Command of the Navy
had no knowledge of the article at all. The article originated in the
manner that I have just described to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Did you at any time speak with anyone in the
High Command of the Navy, or with Grossadmiral Raeder about
this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Only here in the prison.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Herr Fritzsche, is it correct that in September of
1939 the <span class='it'>Times</span> claimed that in Czechoslovakia Germans had
murdered 10,000 Czechs at Prague, including the Lord Mayor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not know whether that was published in the
Times, but at any rate it was published in the <span class='it'>News Chronicle</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: What did the Propaganda Ministry undertake to
do thereupon?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: German and foreign journalists were taken to
Prague. If I am not mistaken, one of the foreign journalists who
went along to Prague on that trip is present in this courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: What did these foreign journalists find out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: They had an interview with the Lord Mayor of
Prague, who allegedly had been killed; they traveled about the
country, and they reported accordingly.
<span class='pageno' title='193' id='Page_193'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: According to that, the report was clearly untrue?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: At that time this report was shown to be quite
false. However, I must add that since Monday of this week, since
the testimony given by Herr Von Neurath, it has become quite
clear to me that under cover of this great and effective denial an
action of arrests was actually carried out in Czechoslovakia. I must
add this; I have to clarify this. And if...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, how does this affect Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I believe that in a certain way it
is a parallel case to the article in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>, which
the Prosecution is stressing for reasons not quite clear to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks the evidence is not
competent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Herr Fritzsche, do you know what Dr. Goebbels’
attitude was to Grossadmiral Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: From the few statements which Goebbels made
about Grossadmiral Raeder it could be seen that he had an adverse
attitude toward him. His reason, frequently expressed, was Raeder’s
negative attitude toward the Party and the Party’s wishes and his
positive attitude on Church matters, including the protection which
he accorded Navy clergymen who were subject to attacks on the
part of the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Witness, you stated that a General Niedermeier was
present at the conference which took place between Molotov and
Ribbentrop. Just where did you get your information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: There is a mistake contained in your question. I did
not say that General Niedermeier participated in this conference.
What I did say was—and I shall be a little more explicit—that
during my imprisonment I ran into this General Niedermeier who,
for weeks or months just before that time, had shared a cell with
the interpreter who had the task of interpreting the discussion of
Molotov and Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Did General Niedermeier give you the name of this
interpreter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Without doubt, but I did not try to remember it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: I have one more question. After the last discussion
on 30 August 1939 between the British Ambassador Sir Nevile
Henderson and the then Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop, in which
the conditions for negotiating with Poland were made public, these
conditions were published the next day in the <span class='it'>Daily Telegraph</span>; and
allegedly this issue of the paper was recalled. What do you know
about this article?
<span class='pageno' title='194' id='Page_194'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: First of all, I should like to correct another error
which has found its way into your question. On the following
morning in question, the <span class='it'>Daily Telegraph</span> did not publish the conditions
or the note, but only published a report that during the
preceding night the British Government had been in consultation on
the German demands to Poland, conditions which had been transmitted
to them by their Ambassador in Berlin. Therefore it could
be seen from this article—at any rate, it could not be interpreted
in any other way—that these conditions were known in London.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Herr Fritzsche, you stated yesterday that the
<span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> was in direct contact with the Führer and
with the Führer’s headquarters throughout the war. What individual
members on the staff of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> were you
referring to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I was not especially referring to people in the
<span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>; I was thinking mainly of people at the
Führer’s headquarters. So, Dr. Dietrich and his delegates made it
their business always to call the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> directly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: You know that Rosenberg was no longer the chief
editor of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> after 1937?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am of the conviction that even before that time
he held that position in name only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Witness, can you tell the Court, as far as the so-called
actions of the Party were concerned—for instance the burning
of the books, the boycott in April of 1933, the pogrom in November
of 1938—who the driving force in all of these actions was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Today I am of the firm conviction that it was
Dr. Goebbels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Witness, do you know that Goebbels, whenever
Hitler was in Berlin, always was Hitler’s guest?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That does not hold quite true. Years before the
war Dr. Goebbels saw Hitler, without doubt, only rarely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I have another question. Do you know that
Goebbels had a direct telephone line to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is news to me. This is the first time I heard
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, this has nothing to do with
Rosenberg, has it, the fact that Goebbels had a direct line to Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Mr. President, I wanted only to ask Fritzsche by
that whether Rosenberg had the same connection with Hitler as
Goebbels.
<span class='pageno' title='195' id='Page_195'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not know what telephone lines Rosenberg had,
but I know and I have heard frequently that Rosenberg seldom
visited Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Thank you very much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is there any other defendant’s counsel who
wants to ask questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then we will recess.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GENERAL R. A. RUDENKO (Chief Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.):
I should like to begin the cross-examination in determining the role
which German propaganda played in the criminal activity of the
Hitler Government. Tell me, do you admit that German propaganda
disseminated racial theories and introduced into the minds of the
German people the ideas of the superiority of the German race—that
means, the idea of the “master race”? Do you admit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The question touches upon two problems. May I
reply to both of them? I admit that German propaganda spread
the racial theory, but I deny that German propaganda spread the
theory of the “master race.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You do not admit it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You admit that the German propaganda
incited in the German people racial hatred toward the Jews
and propagated the necessity of their extermination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Once again two problems are contained in this
question. May I answer to both?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I beg your pardon, you do not have to
emphasize this. Just answer the question; if there are two,
answer two.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I admit, as I have done in my answer to your first
question, that German propaganda spread the racial theory but I
deny most emphatically that German propaganda had made preparations
for, or had called for, the mass murder of Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: But you do not deny that German propaganda
preached to the German people racial hatred toward Jews? You
do not deny that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot even affirm that without reserve. That is
the reason why, in my answer to the second question, I made a
<span class='pageno' title='196' id='Page_196'></span>
slight distinction. German propaganda, and under that I understand
official German propaganda, did not even preach racial hatred.
It only spoke about racial distinctions, and that is something quite
different; but I will admit that there was a certain type of German
propaganda which went beyond that and which did preach the
clear-cut and primitive racial hatred.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You will admit that the activity of German
propaganda was also directed against the Church?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, even that I have to deny.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Will you pretend that the German propaganda
was not directed toward the persecution of the Church?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is exactly what I wanted to say. The official
German propaganda did not persecute the churches. On the other
hand, in order to clear up this point for you, here again there was
an unofficial, illegal propaganda which preached against the Church.
However, the State and its organizations, during the time of the
struggle with the Church, made many utterances and declarations
which might have created an impression as if they had participated
in the struggle against the churches. By this I mean the trials
against clergymen which were given sensational importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You will admit that the propaganda
conducted by the Hitlerite Government in connection with
the so-called problem of the expansion of the Lebensraum of
Germany, cultivated and developed in the German nation militaristic
tendencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I deny that, too, and most emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Do you admit that German propaganda used
provocative methods, lies, and slander in order to camouflage the
aggressive plans of the Hitlerite Government?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Mr. Prosecutor, it is most difficult for me to
answer that question after all I have voluntarily testified to in this
courtroom yesterday. If I am to make the attempt to summarize
very briefly, then I shall have to say this: I maintain that the
German propaganda gave the German nation in the case of every
individual action which was carried out, from the occupation of the
Rhineland to the attack against the Soviet Union, a picture of the
events which, among the Germans, must have created the impression
that we were in the right. On the other hand, however,
I myself—and I explained already when this happened—had
recognized that the structure of these arguments had a basis which
was shaky in various respects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is to say, on the basis of lies and
slander?
<span class='pageno' title='197' id='Page_197'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. Please let me apologize, but your way of
putting it does not appear to be quite factual enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You will persist then in denying that German
propaganda used methods of slander and lies; you do deny this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, certainly, I deny it, based on my thorough
knowledge of German propaganda; and I should like you to permit
me to give you a very brief explanation in this connection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Please, will you give an explanation, but
directly, to my question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: But of course. Looking at it today, it was the
misfortune of the German people that its propaganda, particularly
with regard to those details which can be checked and controlled,
was so clean that it was completely overlooked that in its three
basic principles there were three fundamental mistakes. I cannot be
more explicit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: What kind of mistakes are you speaking
about?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The first, the trust in Adolf Hitler’s humaneness,
which was destroyed by the order to murder 5 million people; the
second, the trust in the ethical purity of the system, which was
destroyed by the orders to apply torture; and the third, the absolute
trust in Adolf Hitler’s peaceful intentions, shaken by what has been
brought up in this courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, we shall revert to these questions later
when we speak about your personal participation in the conducting
of the German propaganda. I should like to ask you now the following:
Of course you were aware that in the OKW there was a
special section for propaganda, which was subordinate directly to
Defendant Jodl?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That was known to me, but you are mistaken if
you are under the impression that that department was under
Defendant Jodl. It was under the jurisdiction of General Von Wedel
and he was succeeded by Standartenführer Gunter d’Alquen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I do not wish to deal with this
subject any longer, at the moment. I am interested in something
else; what were the relations between the Ministry of Propaganda
and the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot tell you what they were between the
Ministry of Propaganda and the OKW in general, but I can give you
detailed information about the relationship between the Ministry of
Propaganda and the Propaganda Department of the OKW which
you have just mentioned. A permanent representative from that
department worked in the ministerial office of Dr. Goebbels. He
<span class='pageno' title='198' id='Page_198'></span>
participated daily in the ministry conferences which I have already
mentioned once, he who was really always to be found in close
proximity to Dr. Goebbels.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Who gave the propaganda tasks and the
directives to the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I can only imagine that the propaganda tasks of
the OKW were drawn up according to Dr. Goebbels’ wishes and to
the instructions of the Chief of the OKW, which was Keitel or Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: How was the general German propaganda
applied with regard to the propaganda tasks and measures taken by
the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am afraid I do not quite understand the meaning
of your question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: How was the general German propaganda
brought into line with the propaganda measures taken by the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Very probably it was just fitted into the propaganda
measures adopted by the OKW, because Dr. Goebbels was
so strong a personality that he would not have tolerated any disregard
of his propagandist principles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I would like to have your answer
to the following question: What relations existed between the
Ministry of Propaganda and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Sometimes relations were a bit tense, but during
the later years of the war a representative from the Foreign
Ministry participated always in the ministry conferences of the
Propaganda Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: What part did the Ministry of Foreign Affairs
play in the carrying out of propaganda measures especially in connection
with the preparation and execution of aggressive wars?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: May I say the following to this: At the very beginning
of an action of war, a representative from the Foreign Office
used to appear with a completed document book, a <span class='it'>White Book</span>. I
know nothing about the origin of these <span class='it'>White Books</span>. At any rate,
they were not prepared in the Ministry of Propaganda. In a few
cases I later received some knowledge of their compilation in the
Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Would it be correct to make the following
deduction: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs participated directly and
actively in the preparation of propaganda tasks and directives; is
that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No doubt that is true because the Foreign Minister
reserved for himself the decisive word with reference to propaganda
<span class='pageno' title='199' id='Page_199'></span>
which was connected with foreign policy or any propaganda which
went abroad.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Did you have in mind Defendant Ribbentrop
when you just replied and when you spoke about the role of the
Foreign Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You acknowledge and maintain
that Defendant Ribbentrop personally gave out the propaganda
orders for explaining the attack on the Soviet Union as a preventive
war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That question cannot be answered with “yes” or
“no” but with a very brief description of the facts. The then
Foreign Minister Von Ribbentrop received, in the early morning
hours of the day when the Russian campaign started, the foreign
press correspondents and the German press. He put a <span class='it'>White Book</span>
before them and he went on to explain in a speech what the
situation was and concluded with the following emphatic statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“For all these reasons Germany was forced to begin this
attack against the Soviet Union in order to forestall a Soviet
attack. I ask you, gentlemen of the press, to please present
the facts in this manner.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I should like to determine by this that the
propaganda tasks were given by Defendant Ribbentrop himself. Do
you admit it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I beg to apologize, but I have admitted exactly
what I have said. Your last question is a conclusion based on what
I have said, and to that I do not want to agree.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: However, replying to my previous question
you spoke about the decisive role of Defendant Ribbentrop in questions
concerning the carrying out of the foreign policy propaganda;
is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Perfectly correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well. It is enough; let us skip that question.
Tell me now what were the relations between the Ministry of
Propaganda and the so-called Ministry for the Occupied Eastern
Territories? Please explain to me in this connection how these two
Ministries collaborated and what the relations were between them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: There was a permanent liaison officer who was a
member both of the Eastern Ministry and the Ministry of Propaganda;
and beyond that, there was an institution which had been
founded by both Ministries jointly and which was jointly administrated
by them. It was the institution called “Vineta,” which
dealt with the entire propaganda in the East.
<span class='pageno' title='200' id='Page_200'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, I understand. By what order—or who
prepared the propaganda slogans, as you called them in Germany,
which were intended for the occupied territories? Who planned and
prepared them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot tell you under oath, because I am not
sure about it, but it is my assumption that they were developed
based on the existing principles of general propaganda by Dr. Tauber
who was mentioned, and his associates, in this Vineta institute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. But apparently you are aware of
the fact and will confirm that the leading influence of the Ministry
of Propaganda has been maintained in all these measures.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Quite definitely. Indubitably the Ministry of Propaganda
had the superior initiative here and the greater influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is clear. Now tell me, what kind of
influence did the Defendant Bormann have on German propaganda?
What role did he play in this respect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That role was unusually great. I know that it is
somewhat frowned upon when statements are made here about a
man who presumably is dead. In the interests of the historic truth,
however, I shall nevertheless have to tell you the following ...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: We do not know yet whether Bormann is
dead. We know only that he is not present on the defendants’
bench; but he is, however, one of the defendants. Go on, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The influence of the Defendant Bormann was unusually
strong not only in all the other fields but also in the propaganda
sector. It became apparent in the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, in the general type of Party agitation which I mentioned
yesterday, that of the most radical trend. A teleprint message from
Bormann to Dr. Goebbels with, shall we say, the following contents:
I heard complaints from Party circles regarding this, that, or
the other, would always be the cause of a rapid acceleration of
Dr. Goebbels’ entire machinery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Second—and this is something which I cannot express under oath
in other words—Dr. Goebbels was quite clearly afraid of Martin
Bormann. And he always tried scrupulously to justify in Bormann’s
eyes any actions of his which might have been misinterpreted by
radical elements in the Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Perhaps you will tell us who else of the
defendants who were not named here during my cross-examination
actively participated in the propaganda activities, and in what way.
Maybe you would rather not tell us anything about the defendants
who are present here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I certainly would rather not, but I shall answer.
<span class='pageno' title='201' id='Page_201'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: By the way, a very favorable influence on propaganda
was exercised by one of the offices of the Defendant Kaltenbrunner.
Whether he was responsible for it in person I do not
know, but here are the facts: During the struggle for realistic news
service which I mentioned yesterday, I repeatedly met with resistance
from the Party and the Foreign Office; but I found the support
of a department of the RSHA, the name of which I have forgotten,
most useful. This department used to issue reports about the
general frame of mind or temper of the German people, and these
reports were distributed to various supreme authorities in the Reich.
In these reports showing the mood of the people there was frequent
praise for realistic news, the very thing which had been combated
by the other two parties which I have mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You just mentioned the office of Defendant
Kaltenbrunner. Who else of the defendants could you name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: None of the others played a part in German
propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Defendant Hess is not present here, but did
he have any influence or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Most unfortunately not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Why do you say “unfortunately”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: During the period when he was still in office, he
fulfilled a very beneficial task. He was, shall we say, the “complaint
department” for all shortcomings in the Party and the State.
I wish he could have continued...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, there is no use to speak about it in
detail. Now, let us go into the explanation of your personal participation
and your personal role in the field of German propaganda.
I should like you to state exactly what relations you had with
Dr. Goebbels. Yesterday you spoke about it in detail, but here I
should like you to state it briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The briefest formula is this: Personally, little
relationship; officially, in the course of time, more and more
relationship.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes. Do you know the name of General Field
Marshal Ferdinand Schörner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I know the name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I should like to read into the record an extract
from his testimony. Mr. President, I am submitting this document
(USSR-472) as Exhibit USSR-472.
<span class='pageno' title='202' id='Page_202'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] We are going to hand you this document
in a minute. In order to facilitate the reading of it, the paragraphs
which I am going to read here are underlined in red pencil.
I am going to read the first excerpt; will you please follow the
text—I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Everybody, including myself, was aware that Fritzsche was
not only a close associate of Goebbels, but was also a favorite
of his. He gained Goebbels’ sympathy by frequently copying
him in his political activities and quoting Goebbels in his
speeches. Goebbels, in his printed and verbal speeches,
referred to the conclusions and prognoses made by Fritzsche
as having the force of official declarations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Please tell me, Defendant Fritzsche, is that in accordance with
reality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: May I ask you which quotation you have been
reading, 1, 2, or 3?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I have already told you, it is quotation Number
1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: According to my text, the first one says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Everybody, including myself, was aware that Fritzsche was
not only a close associate of Goebbels, but was also, a favorite
of his.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, that is quite correct. That is exactly
what I quoted. I am asking you, is that in accordance with reality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I should not have expressed it like that, and I
think it is a question of taste. This statement...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I understand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Just a moment. I have something to add.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The expression “close associate of Goebbels” is wrong, objectively
seen, and “favorite”—well, I do not think so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, very well. Let us go further.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You enjoyed the complete confidence of Goebbels and you carried
out your duties in the Ministry of Propaganda entrusted with
fullest powers. Do you admit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Thus, enjoying the confidence and
disposing of full powers, in your utterances you fully mirrored the
demands of the Hitler Government which were made tasks of
German propaganda; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, to the exact extent which I described yesterday.
<span class='pageno' title='203' id='Page_203'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Now, I should like to read into the record
some extracts from your testimony of 12 September 1945. I am
submitting this document (USSR-474) as Exhibit USSR-474. I am
going to read into the record Excerpt Number 1.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: May I have the document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Certainly, it will be handed to you immediately.
Will you please follow my quotation of Excerpt Number 1.
It is underlined in red pencil. I am reading:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“During a long time I was one of the leaders of German
propaganda.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I skip a few lines and further read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I must say that Goebbels valued me as a convinced National
Socialist and a capable journalist so that I was considered his
confidential aid in the German propaganda machine.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Mr. Prosecutor, that is not correct. I know that I
have signed this report but at the very moment when I signed it in
Moscow I stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“You can do what you like with that record. If you publish
it, then nobody in Germany will believe it and no intelligent
person in other countries either because this is not my
language.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I state that not a single one of the questions contained in this
report was put to me in that same form and I go on to declare that
not a single one of the answers in that record was given by me in
that form and I signed it for reasons which I will explain to you in
detail if you want me to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You therefore do not confirm these statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, only the signature is true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right, let us say only the signature is true.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, we want to bear in mind that in this quotation which I just
read and which you deny, it is said that Goebbels valued you as a
National Socialist and a capable journalist and that therefore you
were a trustworthy person in the German propaganda machine.
This is the essence of the quotation; is that right? Do you deny this?
Just a minute please. I am going to remind you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, General, I admit that, I admit these facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, then the quotation was correct, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='204' id='Page_204'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well then, what else are we speaking about?
That means you do corroborate this statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am talking about the record which has been put
before me in its entirety.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: At present I am questioning you with particular
reference to this quotation which I just read into the record.
You are not going to deny it? You admit it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I will not confirm the quotation but I will confirm
once more the contents which you have just summarized again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. The sense is not different from the
actual quotation, but results from it. I should like to remind you
of an excerpt...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. What is it you are saying,
Defendant? Are you saying that you did not sign this document or
that you did?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Mr. President, I signed the document, although its
contents did not correspond with my own statements.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why did you do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I gave that signature after very severe solitary
confinement which had lasted for several months; and I wrote that
signature because one of my fellow prisoners, with whom I came
into contact once, had told me that once every month a court was
pronouncing sentences based merely on such records and without
interrogation; and I hoped that in this manner I would at least
achieve being sentenced and thus terminate my confinement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So as not to be misunderstood I should like to emphasize that no
force was used and that I was treated very humanely, even if my
detention was very severe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Of course, you never thought,
Defendant Fritzsche, that after all you had done you would be sent
to a sanatorium? It is obvious that you had to land in a prison and a
prison is always a prison. This was just an aside, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to ask you about the following: You stated that in
1945 you signed this because of a very strict regime to which you
were subjected; very well—when you arrived in Nuremberg you
were interrogated on 3 November 1945 here in Nuremberg by
General Alexandrov; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: So that is correct? Very well. I should like
to remind you of some of your answers. You were put the following
question—on 12 November 1945 questions were put to you and you
replied. Do you remember these statements?
<span class='pageno' title='205' id='Page_205'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>You answered, “I have very often been interrogated and I do not
know what statements and testimony are in question now.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereupon, General Alexandrov submitted to you your testimony
of 12 September and you answered him, “I am fully aware of this
document.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You were asked, “I should like you to peruse this document. Do
you remember these statements?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>You said, “Of course, there is no doubt about it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And further: “Do you corroborate this document, which you
perused and which was signed by you?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>And you replied, “Of course.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember these statements which you made in Nuremberg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In the statement which you have quoted, all those
passages are missing where I stated again and again that the record
was put before me complete and finished for the purpose of obtaining
my signature. I wished to make 20 or 30 alterations. Some
of them were granted but passages were missing wherein I said in
Nuremberg that some of the answers in that protocol contained a
certain amount of truth but that none of them actually do represent
my own answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I should now like to remind you
of an extract from your statement of 7 January 1946.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors, this is Document 3469-PS. It is not in my book
of documents as it was submitted by the Counsel for the Defense.
I am going to quote from that document; it is a very short passage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] This is Paragraph 39 of your statement:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Once Goebbels tried to coerce me into submitting my texts
for perusal. I refused this request and explained that usually
I dictated a short résumé of my speech immediately before
my broadcast and consequently, so to say, improvised my
speeches. He said it was all right but on condition that if he
would wish it, I should at least speak on specific, given
themes.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Does that not indicate the confidence Goebbels
had in you? Is that not right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No doubt he had a great deal of confidence in me,
and I did not deny it.
<span class='pageno' title='206' id='Page_206'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Let us proceed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this very same document, which I have just mentioned to you,
that is to say, in your statement of 7 January 1946, in Paragraph 35
there is the following sentence—I think it was written by your own
hand. It was in reply to some of the questions put by your counsel.
You say, “More and more I became the only official authority in the
Ministry in the field of radio communication.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Unfortunately I did not hear the end of your
question but you have quoted the passage correctly and I have
written it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: So, it does correspond to facts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, absolutely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, you therefore will admit that in the German
propaganda machinery you occupied the most prominent
position after Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, my previous answer does not contain such a
statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I am asking you that now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I will admit that I had a most influential position
in German radio, of which I was the head.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If you now put a new question, asking who held the second
position in the entire set-up of propaganda after Dr. Goebbels, I will
reply: Dr. Dietrich, the State Secretary, or Dr. Naumann, the ...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Excuse me just a minute, please. I did not
say the second position; I only said the most influential position.
Are you going to deny this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I have no objection to your use of the word
“influential,” but it does not change my answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well, “influential position,” if you like.
That is still stronger. Let us proceed, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the same statement of 7 January you wrote—it is contained
in Paragraph 15:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“During the entire period from 1933 to 1945 the task of the
‘German Press Department’ was the supervision of the local
press and supplying it with directives... More than 2,300
German newspapers were thus supervised.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the execution of this task given to me by Dr. Goebbels,
in accordance with instructions of the Ministry of Propaganda,
<span class='pageno' title='207' id='Page_207'></span>
my activity encompassed the entire news and information
system of the German press and radio.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not know whether you have quoted the last
sentence correctly, but I have certainly fully recognized the first
sentences. It is my affidavit Document 3469-PS. That corresponds
word for word with the truth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SEN. RUDENKO: Quite correct. Please tell me this: You organized
in the German Press Department, the head of which you
were, the Schnelldienst, the so-called speed service, which supplied
the German press with provocative material. Do you admit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: If you will eliminate the word “provocative” and
replace it with the word “propaganda” material, then I will admit it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right. The Tribunal will consider this. We
are not going to argue about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the last question from this group of questions: Tell me,
were your broadcasts on the radio, which were presented with “Hans
Fritzsche Speaks,” considered official Government broadcasts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I explained this subject to you yesterday. Actually,
they were a private work of my own; but the private work, publicly
audible, of a Ministerialdirektor of the Ministry of Propaganda and
the head of the German radio system will, of course, be regarded as
semi-official, though not fully official; and this fact I had to consider,
and I did consider it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right. Now, I should like again to revert
to the testimony of Ferdinand Schörner, which I have already submitted
to the Tribunal as Exhibit USSR-472. I should like to quote
Paragraph Number 2. Do you find it, Defendant Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I am going to read it into the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, the Tribunal would like to
see the whole of this document, or at any rate would like to see the
questions to which these are answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, this document has been submitted
to you in full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, I see. You mean that what we have in
English here are only the parts that have been translated into
English?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, that is quite correct. I am going to read
into the record Extract Number 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I am fully aware that Fritzsche was a prominent collaborator
of the Ministry of Propaganda and that he was extremely
<span class='pageno' title='208' id='Page_208'></span>
popular in National Socialist circles and among the German
people. He gained great popularity, especially by his weekly
war political radio commentaries on the international
situation. I often heard Fritzsche’s broadcasts in peacetime as
well as during the war; and I perceived his broadcasts, which
were filled with fanatical devotion to the Führer, as directives
from the Party and the Government.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you agree with this evaluation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot raise any objection to this quotation, but
beyond that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, is the document sworn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: This document was put into official form in
accordance with the processes which are in use in the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where was it taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: In Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The man who made the statement—was he
free or was he in prison?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: He was at the time a prisoner of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did the man who is alleged to have made the
statement sign it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Of course, it was signed by him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Thank you. And so you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: May I add that it is known to me that on distant
battle fronts or, for example, with German colonies abroad, my radio
speeches were considered, shall we say, as a political compass.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, I understand. I should like to put to you
another document which I will ask you to peruse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors, I am submitting as Exhibit USSR-471 the testimony
of Hans Voss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Defendant Fritzsche, do you know this name, Vice Admiral Hans
Voss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I know the name, but not the man personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I apologize, Mr. President. It may be that the statement
of General Field Marshal Schörner does not deserve too much
attention, but at any rate I am unable to ascertain from the document
the place where it was taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko says that it was taken at
Moscow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: But the record, the protocol itself, does not show
that; and then I have noticed also that the photostatic copy which
<span class='pageno' title='209' id='Page_209'></span>
I have here does not show the signature of the Field Marshal. It
just says “signed.” Later on in the right margin a handwritten
signature has been affixed, but I do not know whether this document
is admissible from a legal point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can see the original and compare it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I am speaking about the Document USSR-471,
which is a written statement by Hans Voss. Please look at the
Excerpt Number 1, which is underlined; I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Fully devoted to Hitler and the National Socialist Party,
Fritzsche rendered priceless services in helping to spread
National Socialism throughout Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that in accordance with reality?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Well, at least I will not object.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: In other words, you are in accord with it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: As I told you, I do not object, but I do not want
to say by that that I concur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: On the other hand, you do not deny this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I say for the third time that I do not raise any
objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I should now like to question you
regarding your attitude toward the racial theory. You gave yesterday
a detailed explanation in this connection to your counsel, so that
I am going to put to you only two or three questions, and I should
like you to reply briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you agree with this racial theory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, and precisely to the extent which I described
to you yesterday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right. In a radio broadcast on 6 April 1940
you spoke about Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your Honors, this is Document USSR-496. I am not going to read
this document as I do not want to propagate the views contained in
it, but I should like the defendant to peruse this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Please will you look at Excerpt Number 1 of this document. It is
underlined in red pencil. This refers to your evaluation of the Polish
nation. I simply should like to ask you about this speech of yours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It is impossible for me to recognize a radio speech
of mine when I see an extract of only 20 lines, considering that I
have spoken about a thousand times, as I said yesterday. In that
case, you will have to let me have the full speech so that I can
recognize my line of thought at the time.
<span class='pageno' title='210' id='Page_210'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Did you not examine the document? This is
a full text of your utterance which took place on 6 February 1940
on radio station, Deutschland Sender.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: General, there are 20 lines here. They begin with
the words, “Considerable effort was necessary to...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is enough, all right. There is no need in
further quoting. That is the document to which I am referring. I am
asking you, is that your speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It is quite possible, but if you give me only 20 lines
of that speech, I can only confirm that: At the time when I had seen
the official German documents dealing with the atrocities committed
against Germans in Poland I talked about that with great disgust
on the radio, talked about what I saw in those documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Shall we adjourn now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I ask you to grant leave for Defendant Rosenberg
to be absent from the Court this afternoon because I have an
important conference to hold with him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='211' id='Page_211'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Defendant Fritzsche, extracts from your speech
dated 5 July 1941 will be handed to you. They concern the opposition
which the German Fascist troops encountered while entering Soviet
territory. My Lord, this Document Number 3064-PS has already
been submitted by the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you look at Paragraph 7, the last paragraph? I do not
intend to read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I have noted it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Do you admit having used those
very expressions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I admit that and I should like to emphasize,
without quoting it, in what connection this statement was made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I merely want to ask you the
following: When, in your speeches you insult the Polish and Russian
peoples by calling them “subhumans” do you not consider that these
are expressions of misanthropic theories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Mr. Prosecutor, I should like to state that I never
called the Russian people or the Polish people subhumans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I do not intend to argue with you;
the documents speak for themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to turn again to the statement of Hans Voss. This
is Document USSR-471. It has already been submitted. Will you
pay attention to Excerpt Number 2? It is underlined. It is just a
short excerpt, and I will read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...and he”—Fritzsche—“understood how to influence the
German mind when he tried to convince them that they, the
Germans, were the superior race and therefore had to rule
over other peoples as their slaves.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Does that agree with the facts?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, it does not agree with the facts; rather, it
contradicts the facts in all points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Let us say it contradicts your assertions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Very well, I will put another question to you. Do you know the
name Lieutenant General Rainer Stahel, who was the former commander
of the city of Warsaw?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am not familiar with that name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You are not familiar with that name? Very
well. You will be handed a document.
<span class='pageno' title='212' id='Page_212'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this is Document USSR-473, and it is the testimony
of Rainer Stahel, dated 15 September 1941. The passage is
underlined in your copy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will read the first excerpt:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Goebbels and Fritzsche took every measure in order to
popularize the racial theory among the Germans and to convince
them that the Germans were a master race and that
other peoples, as inferior races, must be subordinated to the
German ‘master race.’</p>

<p>“In order to convince the Germans of this and to compel
them to believe in this theory, the Ministry of Propaganda,
run by Goebbels and Fritzsche, made a large number of
films before the war and during the war and published books,
pamphlets, periodicals, and other literature in which the
authors attempted to prove the ‘superiority’ of the Germans
over other nations.</p>

<p>“It can be said that as a result of the energetic activity of
Goebbels and Fritzsche the racial theory gained a firm hold
on the minds of large numbers of the German people. This
contributed to the fact that during the war the German
soldiers and officers, having assimilated the teaching of the
leaders of German propaganda, committed bestial crimes
against peaceful populations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Tell me, did Rainer Stahel correctly describe the part played by
you in the propagation of racial theory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I should like to add that the level of this statement
is even lower than that of the other statements submitted to
me. I should be happy if just one of those people whose testimony
has been submitted to me in this form, could appear here in person
in order to testify as to the documentary basis of his statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I believe that during the 6 months that the
Trial has lasted, you have heard enough testimony. Well, let us
go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I have to make this observation: I have not
been confronted with any testimony of witnesses dealing with the
subject matter discussed here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You remember, I hope, the testimony of the
witness Hoess regarding the extermination of millions of persons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I say that you, I hope, remember the testimony
of Hoess, the commander of the concentration camp in Auschwitz,
concerning the extermination of millions of people.
<span class='pageno' title='213' id='Page_213'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I did not forget this testimony, and not for a
minute did it escape my memory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I merely wanted to remind you.
I do not intend questioning you on this matter. I am passing on to
questions connected with the propaganda regarding the preparation
for aggressive war by Hitler Germany. In order to shorten the
cross-examination, I shall quote a few of your own statements,
dated 12 September 1945, which have already been submitted to the
Tribunal as Exhibit USSR-474. Please look at the second excerpt.
It is underlined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I object to the reading of this quotation in the
same way as I objected to the submission of the entire minutes
of the interrogation, and I refer you to what I testified a few hours
ago as to the origin of this record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You already gave an explanation to the Tribunal,
and the Tribunal will consider your explanation. This document
is submitted, and I intend to cite this part of the testimony. Please
follow me—Excerpt Number 2:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In order to justify this aggressive action, Goebbels summoned
me to him and gave me instructions to conduct a hostile
campaign against Austria. Among other things he instructed
me to dig out old documents in the archives which in any
way incriminated the Austrian Government and to publish
them in the press. Goebbels stressed that the documents to be
published must first of all show that the Austrian people
wished to unite themselves with the German nation and that
the Austrians adhering to these ideas were being persecuted
by the Austrian Government. Furthermore, Goebbels said
that the German press had to show that the Germans living
in Austria were being systematically persecuted by the
Austrian Government which even went to the length of
carrying out mass reprisals against them.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And further on:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, Denmark, Poland,
Belgium, Norway, and the Balkan countries, acting on the
instructions of Goebbels, I organized a similar calumnious
propaganda.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, surely it would be better
to ask him with reference to one of these paragraphs: Did he say
that?—rather than to put to him the whole document at once.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, I have only one paragraph left,
and I intended to read it and then to put the question to him.
<span class='pageno' title='214' id='Page_214'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am not objecting to that. I am only
suggesting that it would be better if you put to him each paragraph
in turn, and not put three or four paragraphs all in one question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well, Mr. President; I will deal with it
in this way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am asking you, Defendant Fritzsche, do you admit the paragraph
read by me concerning the Anschluss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No; and I maintain that that is not what I testified.
That extract contains rather the thoughts which the interrogating
Russian officer entertained in respect to my testimony. After it had
been drawn up, the record was submitted to me for my signature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute! What do you deny in it? Take
the first paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Mr. President, I am protesting against everything,
particularly against the expressions applied here which I have
never used. During my interrogations in Moscow I stated exactly
the same things as I stated here in this Trial yesterday, the day
before yesterday and today or as I have set down in my affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Take the first paragraph. The first paragraph
has just been read to you: “In order to justify this aggressive
action...” Were you asked any question about that, and did you
make any answer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, indeed. In many interrogations which were
held late at night, I was asked such questions, and to the subjects
condensed in this one question I answered as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not recall the date, but when the Austrian action was about
to take place I was summoned to Dr. Goebbels. Dr. Goebbels told
me that the Austrian Government of Schuschnigg had plans of such
and such a nature—they have been described in sufficient detail
here—that a government crisis had developed, that Seyss-Inquart
had taken over the Government, that a call for help had come from
Austria, and that now the march into Austria would take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you now telling us what you told the
Russian interrogator, or are you telling us what actually happened
in Germany at the time of the Anschluss?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am telling what I told the interrogating Russian
officer, and that is exactly what took place in the Propaganda
Ministry on the day in question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are saying, then, that this first paragraph
is entirely made up, are you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No; I should not like to use the expression “made
up,” but I should like to say—and I beg permission to do so—which
<span class='pageno' title='215' id='Page_215'></span>
parts in this paragraph are correct. First of all, there is the point
that there was a hostile campaign against the Schuschnigg Government;
such a campaign actually was instigated in the German
press; whether at the moment of his resignation or just before his
resignation I do not remember now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, it is correct, as set down in this paragraph, that
it was proposed to show, by quoting individual cases as far as
possible, that under the Schuschnigg Government those who were
sympathetic toward Germany were persecuted. These are the points
that are correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Strictly speaking, this means that you have
now corroborated what I have just read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, no, sir. There is an essential difference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: From your point of view. But I believe that
you will not deny the fact that you conducted propaganda directed
against the Austrian Government. This is the main point of this
question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I must deny that as well. This propaganda was
not conducted by me, but by my predecessor, as chief of the German
Press Department.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Do I understand correctly that you deny
having participated personally in this propaganda, but do not deny
the fact that there was such propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: You understand me correctly if by the term
“propaganda” in this case you mean the enumeration of those
measures used by the Schuschnigg Government against German
interests as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I should like to read the following
paragraph of the same testimony which says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When Germany occupied Czechoslovakia, Belgium, Denmark,
Poland, Norway, and the Balkan countries, acting on the
instructions of Goebbels, I organized a similar calumnious
propaganda. In every such case I dug out every old document
from the archives which incriminated the Governments of
these countries as far as Germany was concerned, added my
commentary to these documents and attempted in this way
to justify this or that aggressive action on the part of
Germany.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you also deny this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, in that form I deny that as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: But you will not deny that propaganda for
the purpose of aggression was conducted against all the countries
enumerated in this testimony?
<span class='pageno' title='216' id='Page_216'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I contest your last remark. I admit the fact of the
propaganda, and I have described in detail the individual actions
and my participation in them in my affidavit, Document 3469-PS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well; I do not intend questioning you
further, as this has been quite adequately explained in your statements
dated 7 January 1946, Document 3469-PS, and which, in fact,
do not contradict what has been stated. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I see an essential difference. But this Document
3469-PS is absolutely correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well, I should like as a supplement to
this, to read the testimony of Ferdinand Schörner, which is Document
USSR-72 and which has already been submitted to the
Tribunal; I mean Extract Number 3. He says in his statement, I read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Fritzsche’s political activity in his function as official radio
commentator, in the same way as the activity of the war
correspondent, General Dittmar, was subordinated to the
main aim of National Socialism, the unleashing of the world
war against democratic countries and the contributing by all
possible means to the victory of German arms. Fritzsche’s
principal method, applied during the several years of his
activity, consisted in, as I later realized, the deliberate deception
of the German people. I mention that because during the
last years we soldiers felt this deception especially keenly
since in spite of Fritzsche’s false lamentations we knew the
actual conditions on the front and the actual situation. The
main guilt of people such as Fritzsche is that they did know
the actual state of things, but despite this, proceeding according
to the criminal intentions of the Hitler Government,
consciously fed the people with lies or, to use a German
expression, ‘threw sand in their eyes.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Tell me, Defendant Fritzsche, does this characterization of German
propaganda correspond to the truth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is utter nonsense and it happens that I can
partly prove that. Herr Schörner says part of the activity of the
war correspondent General Dittmar was the starting of aggressive
wars. General Dittmar spoke over the radio for the first time in
the winter of 1942-43. That is one point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second point is the following: I have never seen Herr
Schörner. I do not know him and I have never spoken to him.
I should be very surprised if he were in a position to judge whether
I deliberately or unconsciously at any time ever said anything that
was not true. However—and this is something I must add—during
the last few days in Berlin I received indirectly, through State
Secretary Dr. Naumann, a report from General Field Marshal
<span class='pageno' title='217' id='Page_217'></span>
Schörner with the instruction that it was left to my discretion to
make use of it. It reported that he was in Bohemia with an army
which was intact and that he could, if he wanted to, hold this
territory for an unlimited period. We in Berlin should not lose
courage; he could even come to our aid. I do not know whether
Schörner actually made this statement but I think it would be
worth while to call General Field Marshal Schörner here as a
witness, in order to ask him on what he based his judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: The fact that you do not know Ferdinand
Schörner does not disprove this testimony, for you have yourself
stated before this Tribunal that although very many people knew
you as an official representative of the Government, you could, of
course, not know everybody; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: If you will permit me, sir, I should like to call
your attention to something illogical. Even without knowing me, it
is very easy for anyone to give an opinion about the things I said,
but it is impossible for anyone to judge whether I made those
statements in good faith or in bad faith. I am sure that you yourself
realize this distinction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You are speaking again of your personal
participation, but you do not deny the lying character of the German
propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Again I cannot answer “yes” to the question in
the way that you put it. This morning I gave you a basis for
questions which can be put to me. I contributed my share to a
historical clarification by trying to show what was pure idealism
and what were false assumptions; these things are now being confused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I am not putting questions on the basis which
you pretend you gave me, but upon the basis of documents which
are at the disposal of the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us go on. I should like to ask you: Did you know the documents
about the “Case Green” against Czechoslovakia, about the
documents concerning the aggression against Poland, the aggression
against Yugoslavia—and about the propaganda which had to be
conducted in this respect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I heard for the first time here the documentary
data for Case Green. But as you are now again trying to tie this
up with propaganda measures, it is very hard for me to keep
both of these matters separate. Perhaps it will serve your purpose
if I answer that neither in the case of Czechoslovakia nor in the
case of Poland nor in any other case did I know about the German
attacks until an hour or an hour and a half before they were
announced to the German public.
<span class='pageno' title='218' id='Page_218'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Did you say an hour or an hour and a half?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not wish to commit myself to an hour or an
hour and a half. I do recall that in the case of Russia I had advance
knowledge through Dr. Goebbels perhaps 5 or 6 hours beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You will now be handed Document
USSR-493. It is your radio speech in connection with the
aggression against Poland. This speech was made on 29 August.
Its purpose was to explain beforehand the reasons for the German
attack on Poland and it was made on 29 August. I do not intend
reading it, but the gist of this speech is that on 29 August you
spoke of a series of unexpected events which were imminent. Have
you acquainted yourself with this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You do not deny that on 29 August 1939 you
made this speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I do not deny that. I should just like to refer
to the fact...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Excuse me. Please answer my question first
and give your explanations later. This was on 29 August? You do
not deny it. I am asking you, did you yourself believe in these
explanations of unavoidable war with Poland? Did you yourself
believe this at that moment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Whether at that moment I considered a war
unavoidable, that I am not in a position to tell you. But I am able
to tell you one thing: I did not believe that Germany was to blame.
That if this tension should lead to a war...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is enough.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I ask to be allowed to add...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: But please be brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, let the man answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: If you please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: At that time it was a matter of great satisfaction
to me that in the weeks that followed I could see from the Soviet
press that Soviet Russia and its Government shared the German
opinion of the question of war guilt in this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I believe it is not the time to discuss this
now nor did I ask you for explanations on this subject. You did not
answer my question, but let us pass on to another question. On
9 April 1940 you made a speech concerning the reasons for a possible
occupation of Norway. You will now be handed an extract from
this speech.
<span class='pageno' title='219' id='Page_219'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this is Document Number USSR-496.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have that document, Defendant Fritzsche. It is Excerpt
Number 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I do not have it. Yes, I have found it. It is
Page 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Yes, it is Excerpt Number 4. I will
read a short passage:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The fact that German soldiers had to carry out their duty
because the English violated Norwegian neutrality did not end
in a warlike but in a peaceful action. No one was injured,
not a single house was destroyed; life took its daily course.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This was a lie. Do you admit it or will you deny it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, that was not a lie, for I had just been in
Norway myself and I had seen these things. And everything will be
quite clear if you will permit me to read the next sentence, which
says—the next sentence reads as follows...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Defendant Fritzsche, wait a minute. You will
read it later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But, General Rudenko, you must let the man
explain. He wants to read the next sentence in order to explain
this sentence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The next sentence reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Even there, where Norwegian troops, instigated by the
misguided former Norwegian Government, put up resistance,
the civilian population was hardly affected by this, for the
Norwegians fought outside the cities and villages....”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well. Now I will show you a document, “An
Official Report of the Norwegian Government,” which has already
been submitted to the Tribunal by the French Prosecution as Exhibit
RF-72.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, in my document book this document is wrongly
numbered Exhibit USSR-78. It is Document 1800-PS and it has been
submitted by the French Prosecution as Exhibit RF-72.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] Listen, Defendant Fritzsche, how
correctly you described the situation in Norway; listen what the
“Official Report of the Norwegian Government” says about it.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The German attack on Norway on the 9th of April 1940
brought war to Norway for the first time in 126 years. For
2 months war raged throughout the country, causing destruction
to the amount of 250 million kroner. More than 40,000
houses were damaged or destroyed and about 1,000 civilians
were killed.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='220' id='Page_220'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>And that describes the situation as it really was. Do you admit
that your speech on 2 May 1940 was full of the usual lies?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I do not admit that, but I assert that you, sir,
in submitting this extract, are not taking into consideration the
fact that I, in my introduction, reported that I wanted to describe
what I had seen myself, when I made a journey into the Gulbran
valley and which I remember took me nearly as far as Atta. It does
not in any way prove my description to be incorrect, if, according
to the facts ascertained by the Norwegian Government, such loss
and damage actually did occur in connection with this undertaking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I believe that the Norwegian people and the
Norwegian Government had sufficient experience of the weight
of the German occupation, and the government report states
actual facts and not the sort of facts which you stated in your
propaganda. This document has been submitted in accordance with
Article 21 as indisputable evidence, and I do not intend to argue
with you. The Tribunal will take note of it. I have a few more
questions to put to you in connection with a matter which has
already been dealt with in detail here. It is the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> case. I will
not question you in detail on this matter, as it has already been
ascertained with sufficient accuracy. I am simply asking you: Do
you admit now that Fascist propaganda gave out to the public
slanderous and false information about the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Whether this was done by Fascist propaganda in
Italy, that I do not know. National Socialist propaganda did it in
good faith, as I have clearly described.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I have already been speaking for nearly an
hour about what occurred here and what has been ascertained. Do
you agree that this speech was a slanderous one or do you still
deny it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I have already admitted that and I also showed
clearly how these statements came about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I am interested only in the personal
part you played in this matter. Why did you take such an active
part in this matter, and why were you the first man to spread this
slander?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not believe that I was the first one to bring
this matter before the public. However, it is a fact that I spoke
very frequently about the case of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>, on the basis of official
reports which I believed. I spoke about this case because I happened
to be the very man who, at the beginning of the war, spoke on
the radio in the evenings.
<span class='pageno' title='221' id='Page_221'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Are you trying to assert that the first report
on the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> appeared in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> in October,
1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I never claimed that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well. Then I will remind you that you dealt
with the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> as early as September 1939; is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, of course, the question of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: And you spoke about it before the report was
published in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Many weeks before that, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Therefore, you were the first to spread those
slanderous assertions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I cannot confirm that, but rather...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. In this connection I will put only
one other question to you. You will not deny that in 1940 you still
spread this version? I will repeat the question. I am asking you,
you will not deny that even in 1940 you continued to propagate this
slander?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It is the essence of every form of propaganda that
it repeats good and effective things as frequently and for as long
a time as possible. I have explained already that in December of
1945, here in the prison only, I heard from Grossadmiral Raeder
for the first time that it was really a German U-boat that had
stink the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I will pass on to a group of questions
regarding your participation in the carrying out of propaganda
connected with the preparation of aggression against the Soviet
Union. You assert that you had no knowledge of the preparation
of aggression against the Soviet Union until 5 o’clock on the morning
of 22 June 1941—that is to say, when the German troops had
already entered Soviet territory—and when you were called by
Ribbentrop to the Foreign Office, where a press conference was
being held. Did I correctly understand your testimony?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. Several hours before that, on the evening of
the day preceding the entry, Dr. Goebbels had called some of the
departmental chiefs of the Ministry to his house at Wannsee and
told them these facts and forbade them to leave or to telephone.
That was the first real knowledge that I had of this fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You also claim that you got to
know of Germany’s aggressive aims with regard to the Soviet Union
only in 1942, and this according to your own observations, is that
right?
<span class='pageno' title='222' id='Page_222'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I do not know what you mean by that. I tried this
morning to make it clear that I began to have doubts as to the
truth of the official German reasons given for this attack only when
I was in prison. I explained that this morning. A second point,
which I emphasized earlier in Moscow when I was interrogated,
was that I observed in 1942—it may have been in 1941—after the
war with the Soviet Union had broken out, that preparations of all
kinds must have been going on for quite some time before 22 June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I will recall to your memory an excerpt from
your statement, a document which you confirm in full. It is Number
3469-PS. In Paragraph 42 we read:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At the beginning of 1942 I was a soldier in the eastern
theater of war. I saw the extensive preparations which had
been made for the occupation and administration of territories
extending as far as the Crimea. On the basis of my
personal observations, I came to the conclusion that the war
against the Soviet Union had been planned a long time before
it broke out.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that statement right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, then, I have no further questions to put
to you regarding this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to recall to your memory two further documents
connected with the carrying out of propaganda, in view of the preparation
of war and the actual attack against the Soviet Union.
I am referring to the minutes of a conference held by Hitler dated
16 July 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document, Mr. President, is Number L-221 and has already
been submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] This document will be handed to you
and I will quote one or two paragraphs on the first page. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Now it is essential that we do not disclose our aims to the
whole world. There is also no need for that; the main thing
is that we ourselves know what we want. But on no account
should we render our task more difficult by making superfluous
declarations. Such declarations are superfluous for
within the reach of our power we can do everything, and
what is beyond our power we will not be able to do anyway.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And further:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“What we tell the world about our motives for our actions
must be governed by tactical considerations. We must act
here in exactly the same way as we did in the case of Norway,
Denmark, Holland, and Belgium. In those cases, too, we
<span class='pageno' title='223' id='Page_223'></span>
did not say anything about our aims, and we shall have the
prudence to adhere to this method in the future.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did you have any knowledge of such directives of Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I did not know of any such directive, but the
fact that such statements and directives have been submitted in
this courtroom has made me realize, I have said, that some of the
premises of our propaganda have no foundation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You also had no knowledge either
of the instructions issued by the OKW and signed by the Defendant
Jodl regarding the carrying out of propaganda in the “Case Barbarossa”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot say that without seeing these documents;
the Case Barbarossa as such meant nothing to me until this Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, this is Document Number C-26
and has already been submitted to the Tribunal. I will deal with
it only in connection with the matter of propaganda. It is Exhibit
USSR-477 in your document book, Mr. President, Document C-26.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the defendant.</span>] I will quote one excerpt, Defendant.
These instructions say:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Propaganda directed toward the dismemberment of the
Soviet Union into single states is not to be used for the time
being. In the various parts of the Soviet Union German propaganda
must use that language which is most spoken. But
this should not be done in such a way that the various propaganda
texts might give the impression that it is intended to
dismember the Soviet Union at an early date.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Were you acquainted with these directives?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I knew neither the document nor the contents of
the directive which you have just read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, but I hope you will not deny that this
was the spirit in which the propaganda was carried on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. As far as I could observe, the propaganda
which was carried on in the Soviet Union had just the reverse
tendency. It tried to educate the various nationalities, such as the
Ukraine, White Russia, Baltic States, and so forth, for independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I would like to ask you now: When
did you meet the Defendant Rosenberg for the first time, and when
did you get his information concerning the tasks of German propaganda
in the East?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I doubt whether before this Trial I ever spoke
with Herr Rosenberg, but I do believe I met him socially. However,
never in my life have I had an official conversation with him.
<span class='pageno' title='224' id='Page_224'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. You will be handed Document
Number 1039-PS. This is Rosenberg’s report on the preparatory
work concerning matters connected with the eastern countries. This
document has already been submitted to the Defendant Rosenberg
and he did not deny it, but confirmed it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like you to turn to the second quotation which is marked.
In order to shorten this cross-examination, I will not read the whole
quotation. This report states:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Apart from these negotiations”—about which we spoke before—“I
received the responsible representatives of the entire
propaganda organization, namely Ministerial Director Fritzsche,
Minister Schmidt, Reich Superintendent of Broadcasting
Glasmeier, Dr. Grothe for the OKW, and others. Without
going into details as to political objectives, I instructed the
above-mentioned persons in confidence about the necessary
attitude, with the request to tone down the whole terminology
of the press on uniform lines, without issuing any statements.</p>

<p>“The schemes for dealing substantially with questions concerning
the eastern countries, which were prepared a long
time ago, have now been issued by my office and I have
passed them on to the propaganda representatives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Did Defendant Rosenberg correctly describe these events which
occurred in 1941, before the attack against the Soviet Union?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. I do not recall ever having been received by
Rosenberg. In any case I never received before 22 June, from Rosenberg
or from any of his colleagues, any report about the planned
attack on the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, and this perhaps may clarify matters, I do
recall that a colleague of Rosenberg’s frequently came to see me or
my colleagues. I even recall his name; he was chief of a press
group, Major Kranz, formerly an editor of the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span>.
This man frequently came to see me and my colleagues and transmitted
certain wishes of Rosenberg’s pertaining to press propaganda.
But in any case this was not before 22 June.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: This means that as far as you are concerned
what Rosenberg writes in his report is not true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Untrue would be saying too much. It may be that
this information of which he talks refers to a later period of time.
I cannot judge that, as I have not read the entire document. It may
also be that Rosenberg, in this report, was not quite accurate when
he mentions the reception of the responsible representatives of the
entire propaganda organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. In this connection I would like to
put two questions to you. First of all, I would like to refer to the
<span class='pageno' title='225' id='Page_225'></span>
written testimony of Hans Voss, which is Document USSR-471, and
which you already have. It is Excerpt Number 3 of Document
USSR-471. Have you found it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I have found it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After the defeat of the German troops at Stalingrad and
after the start of the general Soviet offensive on the whole
Eastern Front, Goebbels and Fritzsche took great pains to
shape German propaganda in such a way as to help Hitler
very effectively in mastering the situation at the front. This
propaganda was based on the hope that the Germans would
succeed in holding out for a long time. There was an attempt
to frighten the German population by disseminating calumnious
reports of the brutal acts of the Russian soldiers and the
intention of the Soviet Union to annihilate the German nation.</p>

<p>“In the last stage of the war the propaganda conducted by
Goebbels and Fritzsche made one last attempt to serve Hitler
and to organize resistance to Soviet troops.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It is not only incorrect, it is nonsense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You frequently used such terminology. Obviously
it is a sign of a professional practice. All right, I do not
intend to enter into polemics with you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like you to take a look at your testimony of 12 September
1945. It is the third excerpt of the Document USSR-474.
Have you found that passage? I will quote your explanations concerning
this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: All of them are not my statements. What passage
are you referring to, sir?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I mean marked Excerpt Number 3, which begins
with the words, “The military aggression against the Soviet
Union.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Please pay attention:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Since we had a treaty with the Soviet Union the military
attack on the Soviet Union was prepared by Germany in
secret. Therefore, during the period of preparation for war
against the Soviet Union, no propaganda was carried on.
Accordingly, the German propaganda authorities did not
begin active anti-Soviet propaganda until after the war started
on the Eastern Front.
<span class='pageno' title='226' id='Page_226'></span></p>

<p>“It must be added that the main task to which Goebbels set
the whole propaganda machinery was to justify Germany’s
expansionist policy toward the Soviet Union.</p>

<p>“From this point of view, as chief of the German press and
radio, I organized a vast campaign of anti-Soviet propaganda,
attempting to convince the public at large that the Soviet
Union and not Germany was the guilty party in this war.
I must, however, state that we had no documentary basis for
accusing the Soviet Union of preparing an armed attack on
Germany.</p>

<p>“In my radio talks I tried especially to instill fear of the
horrors of Bolshevism in the hearts of the peoples of Europe
and the German population. Thus I asserted that only Fascist
Germany was the protective barrier for the European countries
against Anglo-American ‘plutocracy’ and ‘Red imperialism.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you admit this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Here again actual statements made by me have
been distorted. If I may, I want to give you the factual basis briefly
for the various points.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is correct to say that I stated in Moscow that the war against
the Soviet Union had not been prepared for by propaganda, because
this war came very suddenly and as a surprise. Furthermore, it is
correct to say that after the attack on the Soviet Union it was the
main task of German propaganda to justify the necessity of this
attack; therefore we had to emphasize again and again that we had
merely forestalled a Soviet attack. Further, it is correct that I
said that the next task for propaganda was to show that not Germany
but Russia was guilty of this war, which amounts to practically
the same thing. Unfortunately the most important argument
which I quoted is omitted from this record, namely, that I and with
me millions of Germans believed the official communiqués given out
by the German Government because it would have seemed to us
nonsensical and crazy if in the middle of a war which had not yet
been decided in the West, we wantonly and willfully risked another
war in the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continue. It is also correct that the evidence given in the <span class='it'>White
Book</span> published by the Foreign Office at the time was rather meager
and it is furthermore correct to say that German propaganda wanted
to make Europe afraid of Bolshevism. It is finally correct that German
propaganda again and again emphasized the fact that Germany
was the only bulwark against the Soviet world revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I would now like to draw your
attention to Excerpt Number 4 of the same document, which is in
<span class='pageno' title='227' id='Page_227'></span>
your possession, in connection with propaganda to keep alive the
spirit of resistance in the German people, notwithstanding all evidence
of Germany’s obvious defeat. I would like to read this very
short Excerpt Number 4 from the same document Number USSR-474.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Beginning in 1943 I tried my best to assert through German
radio propaganda that Germany was in possession of weapons
which would shake the power of our enemies. For this I used
invented data regarding the output of the German war industry
which had been given me by the Reich Minister for
Munitions, Speer.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: One part is wrong and the other part that is correct
has been wrongly stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To begin with the latter part: It is correct that I received figures
from the Ministry for Armaments and War Production which gave
me great hopes for progress. I received, for instance, figures dealing
with monthly aircraft production, figures dealing with new and
especially effective fighter planes. In the meantime, through direct
questioning of Speer himself, I have ascertained that the figures
which I received were quite correct at the time and that the airplanes
either were used wrongly, as, for instance, in the Ardennes
offensive instead of for the protection of the home country, or that
they could not be used because of the gasoline shortage. The first
half however...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You are going too much into details, Defendant
Fritzsche. You are going into a lot of details which have already
been dealt with here and which have nothing to do with you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would like to submit to you the testimony of Speer, who was
interrogated by the Soviet prosecutor here in Nuremberg on 14 November
1945. I submit this document as USSR-492. I would like
to read into the record only that part of the document which deals
with the carrying out of propaganda during this particular period.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In September 1944 I wrote a letter to Dr. Goebbels...In this
letter I warned Goebbels that it was wrong to keep on giving
out propaganda about new V-weapons, for in this way he
would merely arouse vain hopes in the German people. This
was secret propaganda which was carried out by Dr. Goebbels
in order to inspire in the German people the hope of a
favorable outcome of the war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Only partially. It is a fact that Dr. Goebbels, more
than a year before the use of the first V-weapon, himself made
<span class='pageno' title='228' id='Page_228'></span>
propaganda with it. On the other hand, Speer in the meantime has
stated in his testimony here that he now knows the actual source
of the propaganda dealing with “miracle weapons,” namely Standartenführer
Schwarz van Berk. Finally, Dr. Goebbels in the last
months of 1944, likewise tried to stifle this “miracle weapon” propaganda
which he himself had once instigated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Now, I would like to remind you of the part
you played in this propaganda. You propagandized these new
weapons to instill in the hearts of the German people the hope of
a successful resistance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit to you Document USSR-496. You already have it. It is
your radio speech of 1 July 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General, are you going to finish very soon or
shall we adjourn now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I believe we should adjourn now, Mr. President,
because I will still need about half an hour.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Well, Excerpt Number 6 from Document USSR-496
has been submitted to you. It is your speech, dated 1 July 1944.
I am going to read it into the record:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“We Germans have been very reserved in our reports on the
effect of the new weapons. We could afford this reserve,
knowing that sometime or other Britain would break the
silence with which she tried at first to gloss over the effect
of the V-1. We were right about it. Reports from Britain
during the last few days, and especially today, prove that
the effects of the first thrusts with the new weapon are becoming
all too obvious. It is completely beside the point for
the British to complain now about the wave of hatred which
is supposed to surge from Germany against the British Isles.
In the fifth year of the war it is useless to talk about feelings,
although much could be said about this.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you admit, Defendant Fritzsche, that by means of such propaganda
you duped the German people and incited them to senseless
resistance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: On the contrary, in this case I spoke much more
reservedly and much more modestly than, for instance, the German
press did about the results of the V-1. For that matter the very
next sentence following your quotation reads, “We can only repeat
that for us the V-1 is the means with which we can break the
enemy terror.”
<span class='pageno' title='229' id='Page_229'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Now I should like to remind you, Defendant
Fritzsche, of your testimony of 12 September 1945 with regard to
the activity of the Werewolf organization. This document is Exhibit
USSR-474, Excerpt Number 5. Have you found it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I have found it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I am going to read it:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At the end of February 1945 the State Secretary in the German
Ministry of Propaganda, Dr. Naumann, sent on to me
instructions from Goebbels to work out a plan for the organization
of a secret broadcasting station. In reply to my question
as to why this broadcasting station was needed, Naumann
explained that the German Government had made the decision
to transfer members of the NSDAP to an illegal secret
organization called ‘Werewolf.’ Naumann also revealed that
all these illegal Werewolf groups would be directed by means
of this broadcasting station, which I was to establish.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As can be seen by your testimony you were opposed to the
organization of this radio station and you spoke about it with Goebbels.
In spite of this, the station was created, and the former chief
of the Reich Propaganda Office, Schlesinger, was given the task
of directing the broadcasts. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No. Two things have been mixed up here. Firstly,
the plan described in the paragraph which you have read for the
creation of a Werewolf broadcasting station was a plan for a mobile
station and that mobile station was not built. On the other hand—incidentally,
it happened during my absence—on 1 April 1945, by
direct order from Dr. Goebbels, the so-called “Old German Broadcasting
Station” was opened as a Werewolf station.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I do not want to argue with you
about it and I should like to submit to you your own speech broadcast
on 7 April 1945. It is the same Document USSR-496, Excerpt Number
7. Have you found it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: At that time you broadcasted as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“However, as a result of superiority in manpower and material
reserves, the enemy has now penetrated deep into German
territory, and at this moment is about to carry out his program
of extermination directed against us.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am skipping a few lines:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Let no one be surprised if this desire of strong hearts to
avenge oppressed human beings does not even need a short
respite for temporary recovery, but leaps suddenly and unexpectedly
into flame and becomes active. Let no one be
<span class='pageno' title='230' id='Page_230'></span>
surprised if here and there in unoccupied areas civilians take
part in the fight or even if, after the occupation has been
carried out, the fight is continued by civilians, that is to say,
if without preparation and without organization, there comes
into being, springing from the pure instinct of self-preservation,
that phenomenon which we call the ‘Werewolf.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well, what can you tell us now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Although this quotation also has been torn from
its context, I recognize it very well. Unfortunately the passage
is missing in which I spoke of right and said, “Right is a sensitive
concept which has its roots in tradition and ethical consciousness.”
At present...</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Excuse me if I interrupt you, Defendant. I did
not ask you for such detailed explanations. I just wanted to determine
the fact that you not only explained what the organization
was, but also did your utmost to foster the Werewolf organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is absolutely incorrect. This is certainly not
propaganda for the Werewolf; it is in apology for cases of Werewolf
activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Let us drop that subject. I should
like to ask you, do you know who the head of the Werewolf organization
was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That has already been stated here. At the very
head of it was Bormann. Under him there was a Higher SS Leader
whose name I tried in vain to remember during my interrogations
in Moscow. I knew one of his associates, however, and that was
Gunter d’Alquen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. Before putting the last few questions
to you, I should like to ask you, is it not a fact that Rosenberg
and Streicher had great influence on German propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Their influence was negligible. Streicher had no
influence at all on official German propaganda and Rosenberg only
to an extent which was not noticeable to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: All right. I still have a few questions to put
to you. You told the High Tribunal that had you known Hitler’s
decrees for the murdering of people you would never have followed
Hitler. Did I understand you correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: You have understood me perfectly correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Now, in other words, I understand you to say
that you would have gone against Hitler?
<span class='pageno' title='231' id='Page_231'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It is hard to say what I would have done. Of
course, this is a question about which I have now thought a great
deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: I should like to ask you, if, as you stated here
to the High Tribunal, at the beginning of 1942 you received information
that in one of the regions in the Ukraine, which was at the
time occupied by the Germans, an extermination of the Jews and
the Ukraine intelligentsia was being prepared, simply because they
were Jews and members of the Ukrainian intelligentsia? Did you
receive such information? Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That was in the beginning. In May of 1942
you were with the 6th Army, and in the 6th Army you learned about
the existence of an order to shoot the Soviet commissars; is that
right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You considered that this bloody order should
not be applied? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: You knew that this order emanated from
Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I could imagine that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: That is to say, in 1942 you knew already that
Hitler’s order to murder existed and yet you followed him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: You are comparing two things which are not comparable.
There is quite a difference, not treating commissars as
prisoners of war and giving an order for the killing of 5 million
Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Then, if I understand you correctly, the fact
that you did not go against Hitler, meant that you considered such
an order to be permissible in the conduct of the war by the German
Army?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No; I considered it was an impossible order; and
that is why I opposed it, and not only passively as others did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: But you continued to support Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Here is the last question. Tell me, during the
war, did you ever concern yourself with the question of preparations
for biological warfare?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Never.
<span class='pageno' title='232' id='Page_232'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Did you ever hear the name of a certain
Major Von Passavant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I know that name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: He was the representative of the OKW in the
Ministry of Propaganda, was he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, he was not. He was a radio expert in the
Propaganda Department of the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: A copy of a letter of 19 October 1944 will be
submitted to you. This letter bears your facsimile signature, and it
is directed to Major Von Passavant of the OKW. This is a short
document, and I am going to read it to you:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“To the Chief of Broadcasting, Major Von Passavant, OKW:</p>

<p>“A listener, factory owner Gustav Otto, Reichenberg, has sent
me the enclosed sketch with the proposal to carry out
biological warfare. I am submitting this to you with the
request that you forward it to the proper office.</p>

<p>“Heil Hitler. Fritzsche.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you remember this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course I do not remember it. At the same time
I want to state that I have no doubt that it is genuine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Very well. I should like to put the last
question to you: This shows that you were in favor of the planning
and the carrying through by Germany of biological warfare, is that
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have finished, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: But I must have an opportunity to answer the last
question. I wish to state that I was by no means in favor of
biological warfare, but the situation was merely this: Every day
piles of letters came in from listeners and these were passed on by
one of the departments to the office competent to deal with the
matter concerned and the accompanying letter, which consisted of
two or three lines, was submitted to me for signature. As a rule
I did not read the contents of the letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fritz, do you want to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Herr Fritzsche, just now during General Rudenko’s
cross-examination you were asked about the radio speech of 2 May
1940 in which you spoke about your journey to Norway. Can you
tell me more exactly when you went on that trip?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I am afraid I cannot tell you the date exactly, but
if I am not mistaken it was at the end of April.
<span class='pageno' title='233' id='Page_233'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The official report of the Norwegian Government on
war damage after Norway’s occupation by the Germans was put to
you. Here it is said that the fighting which had caused this damage
could not have taken place until after you had already completed
your journey. Is that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: That is quite possible, but I should like to say this:
In the extract which the Russian prosecutor has read without
quoting the beginning, I described precisely what I had seen in
clearly stated places; Lillehammer and Godenthal are a few names
which occur to me now. To compare these statements now with the
statements made by the Norwegian Government regarding the total
damage is nothing less than the attempt to measure a liquid with a
yard measure or vice versa.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I have one other question in this connection. Was
this journey of yours carried out before the British landing in
Norway or afterward?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I myself had an opportunity to watch a fight with
British troops. I think it was just south of a place called Ottar in the
Buldrenthal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, General Rudenko, during his cross-examination,
submitted three interrogation records. One was from
Voss, USSR-471, one from Schörner, USSR-472, and one from Stahel,
USSR-473. In the meantime I have looked through these three
records and I should like to ask the High Tribunal also to compare
these three records. I have ascertained that in these three records,
of the statements of three different persons, parts of the answers
are repeated; and they tally, word for word. It says, for example...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are not getting this from the witness;
you are making an argument to us, and you must do that at some
other time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I just wanted to make an application, Mr. President.
If these three records are used for the findings, then I wish to make
an application that at least one of these persons who were interrogated
be brought here in person for the purpose of cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were you meaning that you should see, or
that we should examine, the whole of those three affidavits, or were
you meaning that you wanted one of the people who made the
affidavits to come here in order to give evidence and be cross-examined?
Which do you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The latter, Mr. President. I should merely like to
request that all three be summoned.
<span class='pageno' title='234' id='Page_234'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: All three. I can only ask to have all three called.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will consider your application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Apart from this, Mr. President, I do not wish to
carry out any further redirect examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is one thing, Defendant. You referred
to the Commissar Decree, or order, and you spoke of it as though it
were an order not to treat commissars as prisoners of war. That
was not the order, was it? The order was to kill them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The order which I got to know about in the 6th
Army was an order saying that commissars who had been captured
should be shot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. That is a very different thing from not
being treated as prisoners of war. The answer you gave was that
you imagined the Commissar Order came from Hitler, but it is a
very different thing, an order not to treat commissars as ordinary
prisoners of war and to kill 5 million Jews. That was not a fair
comparison at all, was it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In this case I must admit that my way of expressing
myself with reference to these commissars was not correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is one other thing I want to ask you.
In October 1939 this untruthful statement about the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> was
published in a German newspaper. That is right, is it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In October 1939? During the whole of September
and October untruthful statements about the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> were made
in the German press as well as on the German radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. But on the 23d of October 1939 a
particularly untruthful statement attributing the sinking of the
<span class='it'>Athenia</span> to Mr. Winston Churchill was made in a German newspaper.
You told us about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you continued to broadcast referring to
those alleged facts for some time, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Of course, because at the time I was still under the
impression that they were true and my...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is what I wanted to ask you about. You
had a naval liaison officer in your office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What inquiries did you make?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: This naval officer was not actually the liaison
officer between us and the High Command of the Navy. He was
censorship officer for the entire Armed Forces. Nevertheless I
<span class='pageno' title='235' id='Page_235'></span>
naturally called on his services in connection with naval matters.
And several times I ordered him, or rather, requested him to find
out from the High Command of the Navy how the investigation of
the Athenia case stood. The answer was always the same: “The
position still is that no German submarine was near the place of
the catastrophe.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And are you saying that that liaison officer
of the Navy told you that after the 23d of October 1939?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did he continue to tell you that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is all. He may return to the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Dr. Fritz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now, with the permission of the Tribunal, I should
like to call the witness Herr Von Schirmeister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Von Schirmeister took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MORITZ VON SCHIRMEISTER (Witness): Moritz von Schirmeister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Witness, before beginning your examination, I
should like to ask you to make your answers quite general and as
brief as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you please give the Tribunal very briefly some particulars
of your career, so that the Tribunal may know more about you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I come from a family of officers and
civil servants; studied theology for three terms; 10 years as a banking
official, 5 of them in South America; then editor until my
appointment in Berlin; on 1 October 1931 I became a member of the
Party; SS Hauptsturmführer in the Allgemeine SS; during the war
four times a soldier; the last time from 31 July 1944 on; on 22 September
1944 prisoner of war in British hands; since then I have
been in Great Britain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: When I discussed the subject of your examination
with you a few days ago, you told me that your former positive
attitude toward National Socialism would not prevent you in any
way from making truthful statements here, is that true?
<span class='pageno' title='236' id='Page_236'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I have already told you that I believed
in this cause, that I have sacrificed everything to it, that I have lost
everything through it. It was very bitter for me. But today I know
that I have served a bad cause. I have freed myself entirely of it.
In my last camp in England I was permitted to assist in the re-education
of my comrades. There I was allowed to edit the camp
newspaper. And if I only could, then I would help today to rebuild
a democratic Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: When did you become acquainted with the Defendant
Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: On 1 July 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What were you at the time? What position were
you to occupy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I was an editor in Braunschweig and I
was called to the Ministry of Propaganda in order to become Dr.
Goebbels’ personal press expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What position did you actually occupy in the
Ministry of Propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Up to 1 July 1943 I was Dr. Goebbels’
personal press expert; then I was personal expert to State Secretary
Dr. Gutterer until 1 April 1944; then I went with him for 3 months
to the UFI which was the controlling company of all film companies.
Then, on 31 July 1944, I went to the front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did you have daily contact with Dr. Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Yes, since the outbreak of the war. Let
me describe briefly what my main activities were.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Very briefly, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: During the war I had to look through
all the news and propaganda material coming in from enemy
broadcasting stations and regularly submit extracts from it to Goebbels.
These extracts formed the basis for Dr. Goebbels’ propaganda
instructions which he himself issued every morning. In the afternoon
and evening I had to telephone them to the press section and
radio section. So that during the war, except when my deputies took
my place, I was with Dr. Goebbels in his apartment, I took my
meals with him, slept in his house, accompanied him on journeys,
and so on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What position did Fritzsche occupy at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Herr Fritzsche in those days was the
deputy chief in the department Home Press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Will you please describe the nature and importance
of Fritzsche’s position in the Propaganda Ministry also during the
period which followed. Very briefly, please.
<span class='pageno' title='237' id='Page_237'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I was to get acquainted with the work of
the department Home Press. Conditions there were as bad as they
could be. The chief, Herr Berndt, adopted undisguised table-thumping
tactics. He went about barking out commands and sacking
editors en masse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In ability and knowledge the officials in charge were inferior to
the average editor. The only steadying influence was Herr Fritzsche;
he was the only expert. He knew the needs and requirements of the
press. On the one hand he had to mend the china which Herr
Berndt was constantly smashing and on the other hand he tried to
replace inefficient officials in the organization with better ones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Would it be correct to say, therefore, that Defendant
Fritzsche was not appointed as an exponent of the Party, but
as an expert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Only as an expert. The extremist Party
men in the Ministry did not give Fritzsche his full due. But as an
expert he was then and later the good spirit of the press.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Was Fritzsche one of those collaborators in the
Ministry who had regular conferences with Goebbels?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: These regular conferences had not yet
begun to be held in those days, and Fritzsche did not partake in
them in any case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: So that he was not consulted until he became a
department chief?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Yes; only as far as such conferences were
taking place, but actually only since the outbreak of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In what way did Dr. Goebbels confer with his
associates?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: After the war broke out there were
daily conferences at 1100 hours, which were presided over by
Dr. Goebbels personally and at which he gave all necessary propaganda
instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How many people attended these 11 o’clock meetings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: At the beginning, that is to say, up to the
beginning of the Russian campaign, about 20 people. Later the
circle grew to about 50 people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Were there discussions during these conferences or
was it more or less the giving out of orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: There was no discussion during these
conferences. First of all, the liaison officer from the OKW would
give a survey of the military situation and then Dr. Goebbels would
give his instructions regarding propaganda, mostly for the press, the
radio, and the newsreels.
<span class='pageno' title='238' id='Page_238'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Who presided over the conferences when Dr. Goebbels
was not present?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Normally the State Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And who presided when the State Secretary was
not there either?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Usually Herr Fritzsche, sometimes also
the head of the foreign press department or the foreign department,
but mostly Herr Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did Fritzsche in these cases give the daily propaganda
instructions on his own initiative or how was that done?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: No; if the Minister was not in Berlin, he
was kept informed about news material coming in from abroad. He
would then give the instructions to me or to one of my deputies in
the same way as he did during the conferences. I had to pass on
these instructions by telephone. In Berlin they were taken down by
stenographers and then read out during the conference verbatim as
instructions coming from the Minister. By the way, this must be
seen by the minutes of the meetings. They were always called
“Instructions from the Minister.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: If Fritzsche used written instructions such as you
have described, given by Dr. Goebbels, did he not try to clear up
questions which Goebbels had not dealt with, by bringing them up
for discussion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: When Dr. Goebbels was farther away
from Berlin, it might happen that the latest news did not reach him
in time. In these cases Herr Fritzsche would bring things up for
discussion, consider the pros and cons and then give instructions on
his own initiative. That was then put down in writing; the Minister
read it afterward and he either approved it or altered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: But then, surely apart from the big conferences with
30 or 50 people present at which Goebbels gave his instructions
there must have been more confidential conferences as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: In the course of the morning, naturally,
individual department chiefs also came for official discussions with
the Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Was Fritzsche also called to these more confidential
conferences?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Generally, no. The Minister used the
conferences at which all departments were represented to summarize
whatever he had to say for the press, radio, and newsreels. The
heads of those departments whose special functions were not of
interest to the others, came for individual conferences.
<span class='pageno' title='239' id='Page_239'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: How often was Herr Fritzsche consulted as compared
with, say, the state secretaries—Hahnke, Gutterer, and Dr. Naumann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: The state secretaries could always be
present during these individual conferences and so could the
personal advisers who were always there. Herr Fritzsche was very
rarely present at these individual conferences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What was the position of the 12 department heads of
the Ministry of Propaganda, one of whom was the Defendant
Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: These department heads can be classified
into experts on the one side, such as, for instance, the head of the
budget department, Dr. Ott, and confirmed Party men on the other
side as, for instance, Herr Berndt. Officially they had not a particle
of the authority which was normally exercised by a department
head in a ministry. It was generally known that the Minister was
using them as tools and that when he did not need them any more
he would throw them out. That did not apply to the department
heads only. I remember the unworthy manner in which he threw
out State Secretary Gutterer when he had enough of him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: The Indictment accuses Fritzsche of having made of
Germany’s news agencies, radio, and press an instrument that
played an important part in the hands of the so-called conspirators
in carrying out their plans. Was Fritzsche responsible for the organization
of the press in the National Socialist State and what can you
say to this charge?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: When Herr Fritzsche entered the Ministry,
this press department had been set up and organized for some
time. Moreover, I can also say that even Dr. Goebbels himself
cannot be regarded as belonging to this circle of conspirators as
defined by the Indictment; for, after all, he did not want to drive
us into war, but always advocated the conquest of countries without
bloodshed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: So that the organization was already set up when
Fritzsche took over the department German Press in the winter of
1938-39?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Yes, already completely organized.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: As the head of that department was Fritzsche independent?
If not, who was his superior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Unfortunately Fritzsche was not only
subordinate as department chief to Dr. Goebbels, but he also stood
between two fires. On the other side there was the Reich Press
Chief, Dr. Dietrich, and the entire German press knew about this
<span class='pageno' title='240' id='Page_240'></span>
discord between the two. Although Reich Press Chief, as State
Secretary, was a staff member of the Ministry of Propaganda,
nevertheless he demanded the right to be able to give orders
independently in his capacity of Reich Press Chief. If, therefore,
the Minister and the Reich Press Chief did not agree on a certain
point, then it was the unfortunate chief of the department German
Press who bore the brunt of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: In what way was Fritzsche active in the press organization?
Did he tighten the fetters or did he try to loosen them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I have already said that Herr Fritzsche
was the only real expert of any caliber who worked in the press
department. He knew the needs, the worries, and the requirements
of the press. He knew that an editor could work only if you give
him a certain amount of freedom, and thus always and at every
opportunity he fought to have the fetters loosened. He did much
more than was apparent to the outside world, for the Minister would
make such and such a decision and the outside world would come to
know only what the Minister wanted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you think he has answered the question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did Dr. Goebbels have any objections to the way the
press worked? Was it not aggressive enough for him? Please be
very brief.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: No, it was not aggressive and not obdurate
enough for him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And how did Fritzsche react to such demands both
with reference to individual journalists and with reference to the
newspapers as a whole?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Again and again, at every opportunity,
both during the conferences presided over by the Minister and at
private meetings with the Minister, he spoke on behalf of the press
and the journalists and tried to represent their point of view to the
Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Can you mention a few names of journalists or
papers whom Fritzsche tried to protect in the manner described?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fritz, why should he give the names of
individual journalists and papers? Isn’t it too detailed to go into that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Very well; but Mr. President, may I, in that case, at
least offer an affidavit in connection with this question as Document
Number Fritzsche-5. It is in my Document Book Number 2 on
Page 22. It comes from the editor of the <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span>,
Dr. Wendelin Hecht, and I should like to quote it very briefly:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I herewith make the following affidavit for submission to the
International Military Tribunal in Nuremberg:
<span class='pageno' title='241' id='Page_241'></span></p>

<p>“1. It is true that the Defendant Hans Fritzsche also helped to
protect the <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span> for several years against a
ban by withholding copies of the <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span> from
the Führer’s headquarters.</p>

<p>“2. In the numerous attacks directed against the <span class='it'>Frankfurter
Zeitung</span> because of its political attitude the Defendant Hans
Fritzsche repeatedly intervened in favor of the continued
publication of the <span class='it'>Frankfurter Zeitung</span>.</p>

<p>“Leutkirch, 6 March 1946. Dr. Wendelin Hecht.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>What other influential persons, apart from Dr. Goebbels, were
there in the Ministry of Propaganda?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: After State Secretary Hahnke’s departure
there was only one man in the Ministry of Propaganda who had any
real influence on the Minister, only one man with whom Dr. Goebbels
had some personal relations, and that was his first personal
adviser, Dr. Naumann, who later became his state secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did Fritzsche come to you frequently to learn more
about the Minister’s views because the Minister did not inform
Defendant Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Very often, because Herr Fritzsche knew
that I also had many private conversations with the Minister and
he always complained that he was left in suspense and all at sea,
and he asked me if I could not tell him the Minister’s view about
this or that matter. I did succeed in helping him by occasionally
arranging for him to be invited by Dr. Goebbels to private meetings
in which I spoke openly about Herr Fritzsche’s needs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did Goebbels keep the radio strictly under his own
control?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: During the war the radio was for
Dr. Goebbels the most important instrument of propaganda. He did
not keep such a strict watch on any department as he did on the
radio department. At meetings over which he presided he personally
decided the most minute details of the artistic program...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: That is enough, Witness. Was Fritzsche really the
leading man of German broadcasting, as he appeared to the outside
world?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: By no means. The leading man was
Dr. Goebbels himself. Apart from that, Fritzsche here again was
between two stools, because on the other side demands came in
from the Foreign Office with reference to foreign broadcasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Was Fritzsche in his radio speeches perhaps too halfhearted
for Dr. Goebbels?
<span class='pageno' title='242' id='Page_242'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I myself, by order of the Minister, repeatedly
had to reprimand Fritzsche, because the former claimed that
his broadcasts were much too weak.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did Goebbels also praise him? And if so in what
manner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: If, as was often the case, the Minister did
praise Fritzsche...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We haven’t any interest in whether Goebbels
praised him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Then another question: Did Defendant Fritzsche ever
contradict the Minister?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Herr Fritzsche was one of the few people
in the Ministry of Propaganda who did contradict the Minister, both
during conferences and in his apartment. He was always calm and
determined and often it had a certain effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, may I have your permission to draw
your attention at this point to a document, an affidavit by Scharping,
Document Number Fritzsche-2, which has already been mentioned
frequently. It is at the end of Page 7 and the beginning of Page 8
in my Document Book Number 2. Might I perhaps quote one short
sentence: “At the so-called ministerial conferences it was Fritzsche
alone who contradicted Goebbels on political questions.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, who was responsible for the definitely false or exaggerated
news in the German press during the Sudeten crisis?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: That was Alfred Ingemar Berndt, the
head of the department. At that time he spent whole nights pouring
over General Staff maps, directories, and lists of names, using them
to fabricate atrocity reports from the Sudetenland. Herr Fritzsche
watched this with anxiety. He came to me once and asked me,
“What are we drifting into? Are we not drifting into war? If only
we knew what they really want at the top and what is behind
it all.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And then another question on the same subject. Did
Goebbels, in connection with any military or political actions, which
were being carried out or were to be carried out, ever consult
beforehand with the Defendant Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Not only did he not consult with Herr
Fritzsche, but with nobody at all. The Minister never had any such
consultations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Fritzsche asserts that he did not hear of Dr. Goebbels’
instigation of the anti-Semitic excesses in November 1938 until
much later, a remark made by Dr. Goebbels himself. That does not
sound very credible, because, after all, Defendant Fritzsche was a
close associate of Dr. Goebbels. Can you give us an explanation?
<span class='pageno' title='243' id='Page_243'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: In 1938 certainly none of us in the
Ministry realized that Dr. Goebbels was the instigator. During the
night in question Dr. Goebbels was not in Berlin. As far as I
remember, just before that he had been to see the Führer and he
was still in southern Germany. The conversation which you have
just mentioned did not take place until the middle of the war. It
took place at Lanke, where the Minister had a house and it was on
an occasion when Herr Fritzsche had also been invited. Someone
put the direct question to the Minister as to the cause of these excesses
of November 1938. Thereupon Dr. Goebbels said that the
National Socialist economic leadership had come to the conclusion
that the elimination of Jewry from Germany’s economy could not
be carried out further...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Witness, excuse me, that is enough. We have heard
about it already today. Did Fritzsche later on—I believe it is
supposed to have been in June 1944—talk to you about his general
attitude toward the Jewish problem?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: In May or June 1944 I talked to Fritzsche
in his apartment about the fact that on the day of these outrages
he had said to me, “Schirmeister, can one participate in this sort of
thing and still be a decent human being?” And then Herr Fritzsche
said to me, “You know, I have really always been an anti-Semitic,
but only in the sense that some of the Jews themselves also were.”
And he mentioned a Jewish newspaper, I believe the <span class='it'>C. V. Zeitung</span>...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: That is enough, Witness. Then how do you explain
Fritzsche’s anti-Semitic statements in various of his radio speeches?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: They had been ordered by the Minister.
We had seen from the British press that a certain anti-Semitic
current in Britain was growing, but a law in England stopped this
from appearing in the British press. Now the Minister tried to find
a common factor against which our propaganda abroad could be
directed. This common factor was the Jew.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To give support to the foreign propaganda by the Reich, Herr
Fritzsche received orders that in Germany, too, he should touch
upon this subject in some of his broadcasts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How long do you think you will be in concluding
the case of the Defendant Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I think three-quarters of an hour at the most, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well then, after that the Tribunal will continue
the case of the Defendant Bormann until 1 o’clock tomorrow.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 29 June 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='244' id='Page_244'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-SEVENTH DAY</span><br/> Saturday, 29 June 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I will deal with the supplementary applications
for documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first application on this list was on behalf of the Defendant
Von Neurath, and that has been dealt with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second was on behalf of the Defendant Streicher. That was
withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third was on behalf of the Defendant Dönitz for an affidavit
of former Fleet Judge Jäckel. That application is granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next two, 4 and 5, were on behalf of the Defendant Von
Neurath. Those have been withdrawn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next three, 6, 7, and 8, on behalf of the Defendant Rosenberg,
are denied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next, on behalf of the Defendant Von Papen, have all been
dealt with during the presentation of the defense on behalf of Von
Papen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next two, on behalf of the Defendant Bormann, are granted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The last three, 12, 13, and 14, on behalf of the Defendant Göring,
are subject to the possibility of agreement being reached upon the
question of whether affidavits are to be presented or witnesses
called, and therefore that application is postponed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, before the Tribunal
goes on with the business of the day, I should like to inform the
Tribunal of the results of my inquiries as to outstanding witnesses
and perhaps these could be supplemented by any of the learned
counsel who can.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, as far as I can see, there are the witnesses whom Your
Lordship has just mentioned of the Defendant Göring, dealing with
the question of Katyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next witnesses that were outstanding were three
that the Tribunal allowed to be called for cross-examination if
desired in respect to the case of the Defendant Kaltenbrunner. I
have just had a word with Dr. Kauffmann, and he says that he will
<span class='pageno' title='245' id='Page_245'></span>
not require the witnesses Tiefenbacher, Steinbauer, and Strupp for
cross-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as my information goes, the next is Admiral Böhm in the
case of the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before you get to that, Sir David, on the list
that I have there was a witness called Strupp for Kaltenbrunner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, My Lord, there are three,
Tiefenbacher, Steinbauer, and Strupp. Dr. Kauffmann tells me he
does not want these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Then you were speaking about
the Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, there is the question
of Admiral Böhm. Dr. Siemers was going to let the Prosecution
see an affidavit, and I have not seen it yet; but, My Lord, I do not
anticipate that the Prosecution will require that witness unless the
affidavit is in very different form from what I expect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the only other witnesses that I know about are the
three for which application was made by Dr. Fritz yesterday in the
present case. The Tribunal is considering that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, that, as far as I can
see, is the full extent of the outstanding witnesses, unless I have
missed some.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was there an application for witnesses from
the Defendant Bormann on the 26th of June?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Well, I asked Bergold this morning.
He has only got one witness that he is calling, he told me,
who unfortunately is not here today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I am told he has just now arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, Your Lordship’s information
is later than mine.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It has only this moment come through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But so far as the others are concerned, there is only the one that
Dr. Bergold wants to call now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: So Dr. Bergold informed me this
morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: May it please the Court, only one witness has
arrived. But I have put in several more requests which have not
been decided on, and I cannot say whether these witnesses will ever
arrive or whether they can be found. The Bormann case is characterized
by the fact that not only the defendant cannot be found but
<span class='pageno' title='246' id='Page_246'></span>
almost all the witnesses cannot be found either. In the course of
today’s proceedings on the Bormann case I should like to put a
special application before the High Tribunal which I do not wish
to do just now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. Will you tell us exactly which
witnesses you are referring to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In your letter of the 29th of June you withdraw your application
for Fräulein Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Klöpfer is the witness who just arrived
in Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes. Then there are the witnesses Kupfer and
Rattenhuber who are still not here and also the witness Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Helmut Friedrich has not been located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: No, he has not been found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you wanting to call Fräulein Christians?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: She has not yet arrived either. She was at
Camp Oberursel. She received leave and while on leave disappeared—obviously
she has fled.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got your application of 26 June or
did you make an application of 26 June?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, I did make an application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Whom did you ask for then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Just a minute, I have to consult my secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Fräulein Christians and Dr. Helmut
Friedrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Klöpfer and Friedrich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes, and Fräulein Christians,
My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: On 26 June I applied for the witnesses Falkenhorst,
Rattenhuber, and Kempka. I could dispense with Falkenhorst
if I might have Dr. Klöpfer instead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Klöpfer is the only one who has
arrived, as I understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, the only one who has arrived, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What the Tribunal wants to know is how
many you want to call now, and with reference to the others you
had better withdraw them if you cannot find them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Very well, Your Lordship, I wanted to put in
an application for postponement. The witness Dr. Klöpfer has only
<span class='pageno' title='247' id='Page_247'></span>
just arrived. Up to now I have not had a chance to talk to him and
I consider it unjust for him to have to testify here for the first time.
Moreover, he is not prepared, he does not know the documents
which have been presented by the Prosecution, and I myself do not
know whether he has any knowledge about the things on which I
want to question him. Therefore, I should like to apply for the
proceedings in the case of Bormann to be postponed until 10 o’clock
on Monday to give me the opportunity to hear my one chief witness
and to discuss the case with him. I do not even know whether I
want to have the witness interrogated for he may possibly make
statements that are quite irrelevant. It is not my fault that I have
not heard him until now. I applied many months ago to have him
brought here and I would not have found him even today if at the
last moment I had not had the very kind assistance of the American
Prosecution. I believe—I have also spoken to Sir Maxwell-Fyfe—a
postponement until Monday at 10 o’clock would be quite proper for
my case in order to give me at least time to prepare; if not—my
defendant has not been here and my witnesses have not been here
and I have not been able to prepare anything.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Bergold, you have had many months
in which to prepare your case and the Tribunal has put the matter
back for you already for a very long time and this witness is
now here. You can see him immediately and the Tribunal thinks
you ought to go on. You must have known that the case would
come on, in the same way every other case has come on, in its
proper place, subject to the license which has been allowed to you
to have your case put back to the end and all your applications for
witnesses and documents put back to the very latest possible
moment; and the witness is here and we still have some time to
deal with the witnesses for Fritzsche and documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal thinks in those circumstances you ought to go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Mr. President, it is quite correct I have had
months at my disposal; but if I can obtain no witnesses and no
information—I ask the Tribunal to put themselves in my place.
What is the use to me of waiting many months in vain, months
during which I could do nothing. The witnesses were not here,
nobody could tell me where the witness Klöpfer could be found. He
was only found at the very last moment. I cannot discuss the entire
case with him in 15 minutes. I am just asking for a very short postponement
until Monday morning. The Tribunal will lose only a
very few hours through that. It is not my fault that I have been
assigned such an unusual defendant, one who is not present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Bergold, the only thing you propose to
prove by this witness is the alleged fact that Bormann is dead and
<span class='pageno' title='248' id='Page_248'></span>
any evidence he can give about that. That is what the application
says.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: No, may it please the Court, that is a mistake.
The witness Klöpfer cannot testify as to that. He can only give his
opinion as to the rest of the Indictment, namely whether Bormann
is guilty or not. Only the witnesses Christians, Lueger, and Rattenhuber
can give evidence as to the death of the Defendant Bormann.
But the witness Klöpfer can only testify concerning the Indictment
itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where is the application for Klöpfer? Where
is your application?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: It is my application of 26 May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let me see it. Have you got it there?
Dr. Bergold, do you not have anything else at all in the way of
documents or evidence that you can continue with without calling
this witness Klöpfer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: My Lord, what I have is so small and meager
that I myself do not know whether it is relevant until I have questioned
the witness. Up to this point I have been dependent on pure
supposition. I have not been able to receive or obtain any effective
data. They are all legal constructions which can be made untenable
by one word from the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. THOMAS J. DODD (Executive Trial Counsel for the United
States): Mr. President, I have an objection to any postponement for
this case. As the Court has pointed out, counsel has had months
and he had every co-operation from our office, both for his documents
and for his seeking out of his witnesses; and if he would stop
talking and go out and talk with his witness, who is here now, I
think he might be prepared to go on with his case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Bergold, the Tribunal will go on with
the case against the Defendant Fritzsche now, and in the meantime,
you will have an opportunity of seeing this witness Klöpfer; and if
after seeing him you wish to make further application, you may do
so; but the Tribunal hopes that, if you can ascertain what the
nature of his evidence is, that you will be able to go on with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now have your—I had it only in German before—but I now
have in English your application for the witness Klöpfer, and a
summary of it is that he was head of Section III in the Party
Chancellery and he can deal with questions relating to the drafting
and elaboration of laws and that he is to testify that the activity
of Bormann in the proclamation of laws and ordinances was an
entirely subordinate one. That is the only reason why you allege
that you want to call him in your application.
<span class='pageno' title='249' id='Page_249'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: That is my supposition. There is the possibility
that the witness, of course, really knows much more, for he was
one of the chief collaborators. I drew up my applications very carefully,
because as a lawyer I did not want to submit a fantasy to the
Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have said what you can do with reference
to Klöpfer, and are you still asking to call a witness called
Falkenhorst?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I can only decide on that after I have talked
with the witness Klöpfer. In all probability I shall forego the calling
of this witness Falkenhorst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you heard what I said, Dr. Bergold.
You can now see Dr. Klöpfer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I only wanted the
Tribunal to know that that was the position as to witnesses; and
when Your Lordship asked me, I said that the process of finishing
off witnesses might take 2 days. My Lord, subject to the Katyn
witnesses, it might take much shorter than that, as I am at present
advised.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. And when shall we be informed what
the position is with reference to the Katyn witnesses, as to whether
there is an agreement as to using affidavits or calling witnesses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I will make inquiries
and try to let Your Lordship know at the end of the session.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I take it that we shall not be able to go into
that this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I do not think so. Apart from
that, there are certain outstanding interrogatories which Counsel
for the Defense may want to refer the Tribunal to; but that is the
only other matter I know. From the point of view of the Prosecution,
there may be a few documents which will be put in more
or less to clarify points that have arisen during the case, rather
than formal evidence and rebuttal. They will be quite small in
number and Will not take any time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were there any documents on behalf of the
Defendant Von Neurath which have got to be dealt with?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My recollection is that there
were one or two interrogatories, but apart from that I do not know
of any others.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps those matters had better be gone
into on Monday morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: If Your Lordship pleases.
<span class='pageno' title='250' id='Page_250'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal hopes that counsel for the
defendants understand that the Tribunal will expect them to be
prepared to go on with their speeches on behalf of the defendants
directly the evidence is finished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, it is to try to give
some indication of the time that I ventured to intervene this morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: As I understand it, the proposal
is that Professor Jahrreiss will make his general speech first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I understand the professor is
ready to do that and I thought it would be useful if it were known
that that might occur even on Monday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. Then, now, Dr. Fritz, perhaps you will
continue with your witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Von Schirmeister resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal, I beg to
be permitted to continue with the examination of the witness Von
Schirmeister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Witness, yesterday, at the end of the session, we stopped at the
point dealing with the anti-Semitism expressed by the Defendant
Fritzsche in his radio speeches; in connection with that point, I have
a further question. According to the statement made by Dr. Goebbels,
to where were the Jews evacuated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Up to the first year of the Russian
campaign, Dr. Goebbels in the conferences over which he presided,
repeatedly mentioned the Madagascar plan. Later he changed this
and said that a new Jewish state was to be formed in the East, to
which the Jews were to be taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Do you know whether, in dealing with reports from
abroad concerning alleged German atrocities, not only towards the
Jews but towards other peoples as well, Fritzsche always had inquiries
made at the RSHA or other authorities concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Yes. Not only with regard to atrocity
reports but all propaganda reports from abroad which were embarrassing
to us. He made inquiries sometimes at the office of
Müller, at the RSHA in Berlin, and sometimes he inquired of the
authorities that were directly concerned in these matters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And what other agencies were concerned besides
the RSHA where he might have made inquiries?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: For example, the Ministry of Food and
Agriculture, the Armament Ministry, the OKW; it all depended.
<span class='pageno' title='251' id='Page_251'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Do you know whether in reply to such inquiries a
clear and completely plausible denial was given, or how was a
matter of this sort handled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: There were not always denials, not at
all; very frequently we had quite precise answers. For example, if
it was asserted that there had been a strike in Bohemia-Moravia,
then the answer was: Yes, in such and such a factory a strike took
place. But always and without exception, there was a very definite
denial of concentration camp atrocities and so forth. That is
precisely why these denials were so widely believed. I must emphasize
that this was our only possibility of getting information. These
pieces of information were not intended for the public, but for the
minister, and again and again the answer came: “No, there is no
word of truth in this.” Even today I do not know by what other
means we could have obtained information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Can you say anything about Fritzsche’s attitude on
church questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Herr Fritzsche adopted the views taken
by the minister during the war. At the beginning of the war, the
minister demanded complete cessation of the strife regarding this
question, for anything which could have brought dissension among
the German people would have had a disturbing influence. I do not
know whether I should go into further details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No, I shall turn to another very important topic. Do
you know what reasons Goebbels gave to his assistants for the
various military actions of Germany?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: He gave no reasons of his own at all.
He only added his comments to the announcements coming from the
Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: To quote some examples, can you say briefly
whether the Defendant Fritzsche knew in advance that a military
attack was being planned on first, Poland; second, Belgium and
Holland; third, Yugoslavia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: In the case of Poland, we knew of course
that the question of Danzig and the Corridor was awaiting a decision.
But Dr. Goebbels himself repeatedly assured us, and he
himself believed, that this question would not lead to war because,
completely mistaken in his view of the attitude of the Western
Powers, he was convinced that they were only bluffing and that
Poland would not risk a war without the military support of the
Western Powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What about Belgium and Holland?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: On the day before the attack on Belgium
and Holland events were overshadowed by the state visit of the
<span class='pageno' title='252' id='Page_252'></span>
Italian Minister Pavolini. In the evening there was a performance
at the theater and afterwards a reception in the House of the
Airmen. At night Dr. Goebbels went with me to the ministry where
he occasionally spent the night. During the night I had to telephone
to several gentlemen; and in the morning the minister, in my
presence, presented to Herr Fritzsche the two announcements which
were then broadcast, the first containing the military reasons and
the second containing the secret service reasons. Herr Fritzsche did
not even have time to look at these announcements; moreover, he
had a sore throat and I had to read the second broadcast, with the
secret service reasons; I also had not seen these announcements
beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: What about Yugoslavia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: The same thing happened. In the
evening the minister had dismissed his adjutant, had given him
leave. During the night I had to call the various gentlemen over the
phone and ask them to assemble; and early in the morning the
statement, which up to that time had been completely unknown to
us, was read to us over the radio.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And what happened in the case of the attack on the
Soviet Union?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: That was even more preposterous. Before
the attack on the Soviet Union, the minister, for purposes of
camouflage, had lied to his own department chiefs. Around the
beginning of May he selected 10 of his colleagues out of the 20 who
ordinarily participated in the conferences, and he told them:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Gentlemen, I know that some of you think that we are going
to fight Russia, but I must tell you today that we are going
to fight England; the invasion is imminent. Please adapt
your work accordingly. You, Dr. Glasmeier, will launch a
new propaganda campaign against England...”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>These were impudent lies told to his own department chiefs for
purposes of camouflage.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Are you implying that no one in the Propaganda
Ministry knew of the imminent campaign against Russia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: No. The following gentlemen in the
Propaganda Ministry knew about the Russian campaign—if I may
presume, a letter to Dr. Goebbels from Lammers offered a clue for
it, for in it Lammers told the minister in confidence that the Führer
intended to appoint Herr Rosenberg to be Minister for the Occupied
Eastern Territories; the letter also asked Dr. Goebbels to name a
liaison man from our ministry to Herr Rosenberg personally, and
that, of course, gave away the secret. The people who knew of this
were the minister; Herr Hadamowsky, as his provisional personal
<span class='pageno' title='253' id='Page_253'></span>
representative; Dr. Tauber, the liaison man to be appointed; I,
myself, because by accident I had read this letter; and the head of
the foreign press department, Dr. Böhme. Dr. Böhme, and this is
very important, told me on the day before his arrest in the presence
of Prince Schaumburg-Lippe that he had received this information
from Rosenberg’s circle, that is—and I want to emphasize this—not
from our ministry or from our minister. Otherwise, as heads of
two parallel departments, both would, of course, have been informed.
If Böhme did not know it from the minister, then Herr
Fritzsche could not have known it either. As a result of a careless
remark on this subject, Böhme was arrested on the following day
and later killed in action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now I want to summarize this part of my examination
in the following general question: Did you ever notice that
before important political or military actions of the Government or
the NSDAP, Goebbels exchanged ideas about future plans with the
Defendant Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: It is quite impossible that that occurred;
it would have been in complete contradiction to the minister’s
principles. Not only did he not exchange ideas on future plans but
he did not even inform anyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Now we shall turn to a different subject. The Prosecution
charges the Defendant Fritzsche with having influenced the
German people in the idea of the master race and thus with having
incited hatred against other nations. Did Fritzsche ever receive
instructions at all to conduct a propaganda campaign on behalf of
the theory of the master race?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: No, under no circumstances. In this
connection, one must know that Dr. Goebbels could not at all use
this Party dogma and myth. These are not things which attract the
masses. To him the Party was a large reservoir in which as many
different sections of the German people as possible should be united;
and particularly this idea of the master race, perhaps on account of
his own physical disability, he ridiculed and rejected completely;
it did not appeal to him. Shall I answer the question of hatred now?
You also asked me about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: A propaganda of hatred against other
nations was quite contrary to the propaganda line as set out by
Dr. Goebbels, for he hoped, and to the end he clung to this hope
like a <span class='it'>fata morgana</span>, that one day he could change from the policy
of “against England” and “against America” to the policy of “with
England” and “with America.” And if one wants to do that one
<span class='pageno' title='254' id='Page_254'></span>
cannot foster hatred against a nation. He wanted to be in line with
the nations, not against them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Against whom then was this propaganda in the
press and on the radio directed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Primarily, against systems; it was
Dr. Goebbels who established the concept “plutocracy” in the sense
in which the whole world knows it today, later the concept
“Bolshevism” was added from the other side. Sometimes his propaganda
was directed against some of the men in power; but he
could not get the full co-operation of the German press on that
point. That annoyed him; and in a conference he once said, “Gentlemen,
if I could put 10 Jews in your place, I could get it done.”
But later he stopped these attacks on personalities such as Churchill;
he was afraid that these men would become too popular as a result
of his counterpropaganda. Apart from that he did not hate
Churchill personally at all, secretly he actually admired him; just
as, for example, throughout the war he had a picture of the Duke
of Windsor on his desk. Therefore the propaganda of hatred was
directed temporarily against individual men but always against
systems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Witness, before answering the next question, will
you check your memory very carefully, and particularly remember
your oath. Was it the aim of this propaganda for which Fritzsche
received orders and which he carried out, to arouse unrestrained
passions tantamount to incitement to murder and violence, or what
was its purpose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: No. The minister could not use passions
at all in his propaganda, for passions flare up and die down again.
What the minister did need was a steady and constant line, steadfastness
even in hard times. Stirring up of passions, inciting to
hatred, or even murder would not have appealed to the German
people nor could Dr. Goebbels use anything like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Did German propaganda abroad, especially in Russia,
come under the direction of the Propaganda Ministry at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: I must differentiate here. I do not know
whether I should go into the well-known differences between
Dr. Goebbels and Ribbentrop. At the beginning of the war the
Foreign Office had demanded charge of all foreign propaganda,
namely, propaganda in foreign countries, radio propaganda broadcasts
to foreign countries, and, propaganda directed towards foreigners
living in Germany. Very disagreeable controversies resulted;
the problem was put to the Führer himself, but finally both sides
interpreted his decision in their own favor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Witness, would you, perhaps, be a little more brief?
<span class='pageno' title='255' id='Page_255'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Very well, I can leave that. The differences
between the two men are well known. However, in regard to
Russia, I must add that there both press and propaganda came
under the jurisdiction of Herr Rosenberg up to about March of 1944.
And in this sphere as well, Dr. Goebbels...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute, wait a minute. What has
this Russian propaganda got to do with the defendant?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No; the German propaganda in Russian territory—that
is what I asked him about. He is only going to say one sentence
about it; in fact, he has already said it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: Up to 1944, Rosenberg—to the great
concern of Dr. Goebbels who believed that the Russian campaign
could have been won in the field of propaganda.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: I have one more question to put to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yesterday, when Herr Fritzsche was being cross-examined, the
Prosecution submitted several interrogation records; among them,
for example, that of Field Marshal Schörner, in which the testimony
is unanimous in saying that Fritzsche was the permanent deputy of
Goebbels as Propaganda Minister. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON SCHIRMEISTER: That is bare nonsense. I cannot imagine
how a statement like that came to be made. There is not a word
of truth in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Thank you. Mr. President, I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does any of the other defendants’ counsel
want to ask any questions of the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, the Prosecution do not intend
to question this witness; but this does not mean that we accept
without objection the testimony which he has given here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness may retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, I should like to point out and request
the Tribunal to take judicial notice also of the documents which are
contained in both my document books but which I did not quote.
In my Document Book Number 2 there is another affidavit deposed
by Dr. Scharping, a document which I offer to the Tribunal as Document
Number Fritzsche-3, Pages 16 to 19. This affidavit deals with
the attitude of the Defendant Fritzsche on measures which Hitler
had planned after the large-scale air attacks on the city of Dresden.
May I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of the entire contents
of this affidavit, on Page 16 and the following pages, Document
Book Number 2.
<span class='pageno' title='256' id='Page_256'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fritz, the Tribunal observe that in Exhibit
3, which you have just presented to us, there is a statement by
the person making the affidavit that after the bombing of German
cities in the fall of 1944, “Dr. Goebbels stated that there was no
longer any objection to handing over crew members of crashed
airplanes to the wrath of the people.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal would like to have the Defendant Fritzsche back
in the witness box and to question him about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you ask any questions of the Defendant Fritzsche in reference
to this matter in your examination of him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No, Mr. President, I expected—I wanted to say at
the conclusion of my case that I had expected a statement on this
subject from the representative of the protecting power, the Swiss
Ambassador in Berlin. This statement has, however, not yet reached
me. I wanted to ask permission to submit it later if it arrives in
time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that another interrogatory or affidavit
that you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes, it is a statement which deals with this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: And if I may be permitted to add this, Mr. President,
I also expect a statement from a British radio commentator,
Clifton Delmar. That statement has not yet arrived. May I perhaps
submit that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly, you may. But what the Tribunal
is concerned with at the moment is that they think it material that
they should know...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes, I quite understand, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Fritzsche resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are still under oath. You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>You have read this affidavit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: But I no longer remember it in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We did not hear the answer to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I no longer recall in detail this affidavit which
my counsel has just submitted to the Tribunal. I know that it
exists, however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The statement that the Tribunal wished you
to be asked about was this:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Beginning in the fall of 1944, Dr. Goebbels also spoke
about this frequently during his so-called conferences of
ministers...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='257' id='Page_257'></span></p>

<p class='noindent'>I’ll begin before that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The increasing effect of English and American air bombardments
on German cities caused Hitler and his more
intimate advisers to seek drastic measures of reprisal. Beginning
in the fall of 1944, Dr. Goebbels also spoke about
this frequently during his so-called conferences of ministers,
to which numerous officials and technicians of his ministry
were convened and which, as a rule, I also attended.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is Franz Scharping?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On such occasions Dr. Goebbels stated that there was no
longer any objection to handing over crew members of
crashed planes to the wrath of the people.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>As you know, there has been a great deal of evidence about that
before this Tribunal. Did you in your propaganda speeches make
any references to this subject?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, I never advocated in my propaganda speeches
that the crews of aircraft which had been shot down should be
killed. On the other hand, I know that Dr. Goebbels, for reasons of
intimidation, ordered reports to be sent abroad already in the fall
of 1944, reports to the effect that, to quote an example, an Anglo-Saxon
airplane which had machine-gunned church-goers in the
street on a Sunday had been shot down and the members of the
crew had been lynched by the people. Actually this report had no
factual basis; it hardly could have been true, since it is quite improbable
that an airplane is shot down at just such a moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I know that Dr. Goebbels, through a circular letter addressed to
the Gau Propaganda Offices, asked that details of such incidents, if
they actually occurred, should be transmitted to him; but to my
knowledge he did not receive any factual details of this sort. That
was also the time in which he had an article on this subject written
in Reich; I cannot recall the title of this article at the moment. In
any event, this campaign, having died down in January or February,
flared up again in the days after the air attack on Dresden, and
the following incident occurred. Dr. Goebbels announced in the
“11 o’clock morning conference,” which has been mentioned quite
frequently in this courtroom, that in the Dresden attack 40,000
people had been killed. It was not known then that the actual
figure was a considerably higher one. Dr. Goebbels added that in
one way or another an end would now have to be put to this terror;
and Hitler was firmly determined to have English, American, and
Russian flyers shot in Dresden in numbers equal to the figure of
Dresden inhabitants who had lost their lives in this air attack. Then
<span class='pageno' title='258' id='Page_258'></span>
he turned to me and asked me to prepare and announce this action.
There followed an incident: I jumped up and refused to do this.
Dr. Goebbels broke off the conference, asked me to come to his
room, and there a very heated discussion developed between us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally I had persuaded him at least to the point where he
promised me to use his influence with Hitler himself, so that this
plan would not be carried through. I then spoke to Ambassador
Rühle, the liaison man of the Foreign Office and asked him to enlist
the aid of his minister to the same end. I also requested State
Secretary Naumann to speak along the same lines with Bormann,
whose predominant influence was well known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Following that, I had a discussion—under the existing regulations
this was not really permitted—with the representative of the protecting
power. In confidence, I gave him certain indications about
the plan of which I had heard and asked him whether he could
suggest or supply me with some argument or some means for
countering this plan more intensively.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He said he would attend to the matter with the utmost speed
and he called me up on the following morning. We had a second
discussion, and he told me that in the meantime a prospect for an
exchange of prisoners had been held out to him—that is, an exchange
of German and English prisoners—to comprise, I believe, 50,000 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I asked him to have this matter go through the normal diplomatic
channels, but to permit me to discuss this possibility of an exchange
of prisoners of war with Dr. Goebbels, Naumann, and Bormann. I
did so, and since just at that time the leaders were obviously
especially interested in returning prisoners of war who could perhaps
still be used at the front, this prospective offer...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How did you think that this possible exchange
of prisoners was going to affect the question of whether
40,000 English and American, and Russian fliers would be killed as
a reprisal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: It appeared to me that at a time when we had the
opportunity of effecting an exchange of prisoners of war, all thought
of an action which was quite outside all human laws had to be
repressed; that is, if there was talk about an exchange of prisoners
of war, the idea of a gigantic shooting of prisoners had to be
shunted into the background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I conclude briefly. This plan was discussed. I told Dr. Goebbels
about it; and it was discussed in the evening with Hitler, according
to concurring reports which I had from two different sources. By
some strange accident the offer itself ran aground somewhere along
the bureaucratic channels many days after the settlement of this
exciting incident.
<span class='pageno' title='259' id='Page_259'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Can you hear now? I am asking
you when you heard about Hitler’s order, not with respect to these
prisoners, but with respect to the fliers who had landed? When did
you first hear of that? You said that in the fall Goebbels had sent
abroad some propaganda with respect to that order. Did you know
about it then?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): In the autumn of 1944 you knew
about that order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): When did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot say exactly, but in the autumn of 1944 I
did not know this order. I have to be extremely careful since I am
under oath. I believe I heard of the order only here in this courtroom,
but that is somewhat confused in my memory with the
campaign of Dr. Goebbels which I have just described. I cannot
clearly...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Surely in that meeting in February
that order was discussed when they were discussing the killing
of 40,000 prisoners, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: No, on that occasion not at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): You had no doubt that Hitler
wished to have those prisoners killed, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, at the time when Dr. Goebbels related the
plan, I believed that Hitler wished to carry through this action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Then the answer is “yes.” Now,
you had no doubt that Goebbels wanted them killed, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: The 40,000 in Dresden?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: In general, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes, I had no doubt that Goebbels also approved it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And which other of the leaders
wished them killed? It was apparently discussed a good deal; who
else in the Government was in favor of this policy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I cannot say with certainty whether Bormann was
in favor of it; he was the only other concerned. I do know, however,
that Von Ribbentrop, through Ambassador Rühle, made an attempt
to dissuade Hitler from this step. He opposed Hitler’s plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Ribbentrop was working in this
particular problem of killing the prisoners? I am not clear about
that. Did Ribbentrop know about it?
<span class='pageno' title='260' id='Page_260'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: At that time I told Ambassador Rühle about this
affair and asked him to inform Ribbentrop and to enlist his aid. A
day or two later Rühle told me—we had frequent excited telephone
conversations on this matter—that Ribbentrop was...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): I do not need the details. The
answer is that the Foreign Office knew, even if Ribbentrop may not
have known personally. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Ribbentrop was informed personally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): That is all I want to know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Do you know what attitude
Bormann took in this matter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: According to the accounts that I heard, he at first
supported Hitler’s plan to shoot those 40,000; but afterwards, under
the influence of Goebbels and Naumann, he took the opposite view
and co-operated in dissuading Hitler from his intention.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Were they only consulted in the
matter as far as the commanders of the Wehrmacht were concerned?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: I know nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): It is suggested that I should also
ask you this: Do you know what attitude Ribbentrop took on the
shooting of these prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRITZSCHE: Yes. After Ambassador Rühle’s report to him, he
used his influence to prevent the execution of Hitler’s plan; in what
way, I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fritz, do you wish to ask the defendant
any question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the Prosecution wish to ask any questions
arising out of the questions that the Tribunal has asked?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: No, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the defendant can return to the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Mr. President, this brings me to the end of the
evidence in the case of the Defendant Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you offering in evidence all of the documents
in your two document books, each one of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are they marked with exhibit numbers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes, I submitted all the originals.
<span class='pageno' title='261' id='Page_261'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.
Have you not got two Exhibits 1; Exhibit 1 in one book and Exhibit
1 in the other book?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: No, there are no Fritzsche exhibits at all in my Document
Book 1, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh! I see. Very well. Well, that concludes the
case of Fritzsche?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FRITZ: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: May it please the Tribunal, first of all I want to
say that I can also dispense with the witness Dr. Klöpfer, since he
worked in close contact with Bormann only after 1942, since he
cannot testify on most of the documents on which the Prosecution
based its case, and since he only directed the constitutional law
department in the Party Chancellery.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I want to begin my case by making a very brief
basic statement. The Defendant Bormann is absent; his associates,
generally speaking, are not at my disposal either. For that reason,
I can only attempt, on the basis of the documents presented by the
Prosecution, to submit some little evidence to prove that the defendant
did not play the large, legendary part which is now, after the
collapse, attributed to him. As a lawyer it has always been much
against my will to build something out of nothing; and I beg the
High Tribunal to take this into consideration when weighing my
evidence, which must, therefore, be extremely small in quantity. It
is not negligence on my part that I present so little, but it is the
inability to find anything positive from the available documents
without the assistance of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, then, I come to the question of whether the case
against Bormann can be tried at all. I have offered evidence to
show that it is most likely that the Defendant Bormann died on
1 May 1945, during an attempted escape from the Reich Chancellery.
As my first witness who could testify on this, I named the witness
Else Krüger, and my application for her was granted by the Tribunal.
In my application of 26 June, I stated that I would waive the
examining of this witness if the High Tribunal would permit me to
submit instead an affidavit containing her testimony. I have not
yet received an answer to this application; but I presume, since I
heard from Dr. Kempner that the Prosecution will agree to this,
that the High Tribunal also will not raise any objection.
<span class='pageno' title='262' id='Page_262'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I thought the application was withdrawn with
reference to the witness Krüger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I stated that I would dispense with the witness
provided that I could submit her affidavit. There appears to be a
misunderstanding. The Prosecution informed me that it has no
objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: We have said we had no objection, Mr. President, to
the use of the affidavit since he was waiving the calling of the
witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I submit the affidavit as Document Number Bormann-12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, I named three other witnesses who could testify that Bormann
had died. First, the witness Kempka, who for many years
was Hitler’s chauffeur and who was present when the attempted
escape from the Reich Chancellery failed. This witness is not here.
According to information which I have, he was interned at the camp
at Freising in December 1945 in the hands of the American authorities;
but unfortunately he has not yet been produced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also named the witness Rattenhuber, who was also present
when Bormann died and who, according to the information which
I have, is said to be in the hands of the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The woman witness, Christians, who had been, granted me, could
not be located. She was interned in the camp at Oberursel; from
there she was given leave of which she took advantage to vanish.
Apart from the affidavit of the witness Krüger, therefore, I have
no proof for my statement that Bormann is dead. I regret very
much indeed that I am not in a position to present clear evidence
on this point and that the members of the Prosecution were not
able to give me more support, for in this way the formation of
legends will be considerably strengthened. Indeed, a sort of false
Demetrius, false Martin Bormann, have already made their appearance
and are sending me letters which are signed Martin Bormann
but which cannot possibly have been written by him. I believe
that a service would have been rendered to the German nation, to
the Allies, and to the world generally if I had been in a position to
furnish this proof for which I had asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come now to my documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal would like to hear this
affidavit of Krüger read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: The text is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Fräulein Else Krüger, born 9 February 1915, at Hamburg-Altona;
secretary, at present residing at Hamburg (39), Hansenweg 1...
From approximately the end of 1942 was one of
several secretaries of the Defendant Martin Bormann; there
<span class='pageno' title='263' id='Page_263'></span>
were, roughly, 30 to 40 secretaries. I can no longer give accurate
figures and names. I occupied this position until the end
and after Hitler’s death.</p>

<p>“On 1 May 1945 I saw and talked to Bormann in the bunker
of the Reich Chancellery for the last time; but I was then no
longer working for him, since at that time he was writing his
own orders and wireless messages by hand. All I had to do
in those days in the bunker of the Reich Chancellery was to
prepare myself mentally for my death. The last words he
spoke to me, when he met me accidentally in the bunker,
were, ‘Well, then, farewell. There is not much sense in it now,
but I will try to get through. Very probably I shall not succeed.’
These approximately, were his last words, I can no
longer recollect them literally.</p>

<p>“Later in the course of the evening when I thought that the
Russians had come very close to the shelter of the Reich
Chancellery I, together with a group of about 20 people,
mostly soldiers, fled from the shelter through subterranean
passages, then through an exit in one of the walls of the
Chancellery, across the Wilhelmsplatz into the entrance of
the underground station Kaiserhof. From there we fled
through more subterranean passages to the Friedrichstrasse,
and then through a number of streets, debris of houses, and
so on; I can no longer remember the exact details on account
of the confusion and excitement of those days. Eventually, in
the course of the following morning, we reached another
shelter; I no longer recollect where it was; it might have
been the shelter at Humboldthain.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Bergold, does not the affidavit deal with
the Defendant Bormann at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Oh yes, I am now coming to that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“After some time the SS-Gruppenführer Rattenhuber appeared
there quite suddenly. He had been severely wounded in the
leg and was put on a camp bed. Other people asked him
where he had come from; and he said, in my presence, that
he, together with Bormann and others, had fled by car through
the Friedrichstrasse. Presumably everybody was dead; there
had been masses of bodies. I gathered from his statement that
he believed Bormann was dead. This also appeared probable
to me because, according to reports I heard from some soldiers
whom I did not know, all people who had left the shelter
after us had been taken under strong Russian fire and hundreds
of dead were said to have been left behind on the
Weidendammer Bridge.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit one unimportant sentence.
<span class='pageno' title='264' id='Page_264'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I remember reading afterwards in a British paper that Hitler’s
driver for many years, Kempka, made a statement somewhere
that Bormann, with whom apparently he fled, was
dead.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>That is all I am able to submit, Mr. President; the real witnesses
have unfortunately not been found.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now come to the documents. In order to shorten my evidence,
may I refer to the document book which I have submitted. All these
documents contain orders of Bormann which were collected and
have appeared in a body of laws called <span class='it'>Orders of the Deputy of the
Führer</span>. I request that the Tribunal take judicial notice of these
official orders. I shall bring up the legal argument arising from
these documents in my final speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I merely want to refer now briefly to Order Number 23/36; it is
the order under the figure 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean PS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: No, it is order Number 8 in my document book,
Mr. President. I particularly want to draw the Tribunal’s attention
to it without quoting from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now turn to the document book submitted by the Prosecution,
and I should like to read a short passage from 098-PS, on Page 4,
the second paragraph at the top.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you say 098-PS?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, Document 098-PS, Bormann’s letter dated
22 February 1940 and addressed to Reichsleiter Alfred Rosenberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Page 4?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Page 4. It is the letter in which Bormann rails
against the Christian religion. Nevertheless, he writes as follows,
Page 4:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“With regard to religious instruction in schools it seems to
me that the existing conditions need not be changed. No
National Socialist teacher, according to the clear-cut directives
of the Deputy of the Führer, must be accused in any
way, if he is prepared to teach the Christian religion in the
schools.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit one sentence.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the circular of the Deputy of the Führer Number 3/39, of
4 January 1939, it is expressly stated that teachers of religion
are not by any means to make their own choice of Biblical
material for religious instruction but are obliged to give instruction
on all the Biblical subjects. They are to abstain
from all reinterpreting, analyzing, or paraphrasing of this
<span class='pageno' title='265' id='Page_265'></span>
directive; attempts of this sort have been made several times
by certain church groups.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This is a reference to the so-called German Christians.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I then quote from Document 113-PS, document book of the Prosecution.
It is Directive Number 104/38, I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The neutrality of the Party with respect to the Church, which
has been emphasized from the beginning, demands that any
possible friction be avoided. Clergymen, as political leaders
or as leaders or section leaders in the Party and its affiliated
organizations, do not possess the required freedom of decision
in this dual obligation, as has been shown by experience;
moreover, there is the danger that owing to their church office
they will make use of the Movement for their purposes in the
church struggle. The Deputy of the Führer has therefore
ordered:</p>

<p>“1. Clergymen holding positions in the Party are to be immediately
relieved of their Party functions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I then quote from Document 099-PS, in which Bormann, in a
letter of 19 January 1940, addressed to the Reich Minister of Finance,
criticizes the low contributions of the Church toward the war. I
quote from the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The assessment of so low a contribution has surprised me. I
gather from numerous reports that the political communities
have to raise so high a war contribution that the carrying out
of their own tasks, which are often very important, as for
instance their work in public welfare, is in jeopardy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit one sentence.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I understand that the assessment of so low a contribution is
partly explained by the fact that only the churches of the old
Reich which are entitled to raise taxes are called upon to
make their contribution to the war, whereas the sections of
the Protestant and Catholic Church, which are entitled to
demand church dues in Austria and the Sudetenland, are
exempted...”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit the rest of the sentence.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“This differentiation in the treatment of individual sections of
the churches and church organizations is, in my opinion, quite
unjustified.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I then quote from Document 117-PS, a letter from Bormann to
Rosenberg, dated 28 January 1939. I quote from the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Party has repeatedly in recent years had to explain its
attitude on the plan for a State Church or for some other
measure establishing closer connection between the State and
<span class='pageno' title='266' id='Page_266'></span>
the Church. The Party has always emphatically rejected such
plans for two reasons. First, a connection between the State
and the Church, as the organization of a religious community
which does not in all fields aim at the practical application of
National Socialist principles, would not fulfill the ideological
demands of National Socialism. Second, purely practical and
political considerations speak against such a formal union.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I then refer to Document L-22, which deals with a conference in
the Führer’s headquarters on 16 July 1941, at which Hitler, Rosenberg,
Lammers, Keitel, Göring, and Bormann were present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Could you tell us in what part of the book
this is and what is the number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: L-22. It is approximately in the middle of the
book. Bormann acted as secretary of the conference and wrote the
minutes. The Prosecution stated that Bormann’s incidental remarks
showed that he had participated in the discussion, at that conference,
of plans for the incorporation of Russian territory into the
Reich. I shall therefore have to read this incidental remark which
he made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is L-221, not L-22.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: The first incidental remark is in the 14th paragraph
and reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Incidentally, does an educated class still exist in the Ukraine,
or are the Ukrainians of a higher class to be found only as
emigrants outside Russia?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Bergold, could you not tell us what original
page it is? In our document book there are headings “original
page” so and so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, they are there, but—one moment, please, I
shall have to look for it again. The translation which I have received
has a different type of division—Page 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>“We have to create a garden of Eden....” The first part of
Page 4 is, “We have to create a garden of Eden....”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, yes, yes, the second paragraph, the third
paragraph, no, after each one—it is the third paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Have you got it, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I shall not know until you tell me how it
begins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: It begins, “Incidentally, does an educated class
still exist in the Ukraine...?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I have got that, yes. Page 3.
<span class='pageno' title='267' id='Page_267'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: It is on Page 3.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think it is on Page 4. It goes like this:
“Is there still anything like an educated class in the Ukraine?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: According to the document book which has just
been submitted to me, it is on Page 3, but it may be Page 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The original is Page 4.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Then on Page 5, Page 4, no, it is Page 3, Your
Lordship. Page 4 has a very similar remark which reads:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It has frequently become apparent that Rosenberg has a
great deal of liking for the Ukrainians. He wants to enlarge
the old Ukraine considerably.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then the last remark on Page 8—Page 5 in the English text,
third paragraph from the end, a note for Party member Klöpfer:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Please ask Dr. Meyer as soon as possible for the data on the
proposed organization and the filling of the positions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then at the end, Page 6 of your original, last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Incidentally, the Führer emphasized that activity of the
churches was out of the question. Papen had already submitted
to him through the Foreign Office a long memorandum
stating that now the right moment for re-establishing
the churches had arrived. But that was definitely out of the
question.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>This refers to a statement by Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I come to Document 1520-PS. I want first of all to draw
the Tribunal’s attention to the fact that in this record, which Lammers
wrote, Bormann is not at all mentioned at the beginning
among those present, apparently because his activity as secretary
was considered a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should now like to read from Page 2 of your original, from the
paragraph beginning, “Then the discussion turned to the question
of freedom of religion...” I shall begin on the eighth line of the
fourth paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Bormann agreed with this attitude absolutely but said that
the only question was whether the Reich Minister for the
East, who after all had a name in Germany, would not
through such a law create too far-reaching obligations which
would then have repercussions in the Reich. The churches
themselves were going to define what was meant by ‘religious
freedom,’ and he predicted that such a law would result in
hundreds of new letters and complaints on the part of the
churches within the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>I omit one sentence.
<span class='pageno' title='268' id='Page_268'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Finally it was agreed that the entire question should not be
settled by me”—that is, Lammers—“in the form of a law but
that the Reich Commissioners should take the existing religious
freedom for granted and should issue the necessary
directives.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then Document 072-PS, a letter from Bormann to Rosenberg; of
that I should like to read the third paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Führer emphasized that in the Balkans the use of your
experts would not be necessary, since there were no art objects
to be confiscated. In Belgrade there was only the collection
of Prince Paul which would be returned to him intact.
The remaining material of the lodges, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, would be
taken care of by the representatives of Gruppenführer
Heydrich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From Document 062-PS I should like to read the introduction, in
which the Defendant Hess deals with the orders he had issued for
the treatment of airmen. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The French civilian population received official instructions
by radio and otherwise on what they were to do at landings
of German aircraft.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>From Document 205-PS I should like to read the opening words
of Bormann, the second paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What, is the date of 062-PS? [<span class='it'>The interpreter
wrongly translated this as 205-PS.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: 5th of May 1943, circular letter Number 70/43.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think I have got it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE INTERPRETER: You have 205, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: 5th of May 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, but I wanted to know the date of 062-PS.
It appears to be 13 March 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: 062-PS? Yes, the date of that is 13 March 1940.
That is the one I read before.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal does not understand why you
read the document in view of Paragraph 4 of it which is as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Likewise, enemy parachutists are immediately to be arrested
or liquidated.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I shall return to that in my final speech,
Mr. President. I can present my arguments now if the Tribunal so
desires, but I do not think the argument is wanted now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, no; I thought you might have another
paragraph in the document which you wish to refer to.
<span class='pageno' title='269' id='Page_269'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: No. I referred to the introduction, which was
the reason for this document, namely, the statement of the Defendant
Hess preceding Bormann’s document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I come then to Document 205-PS, dated 5 May 1943, circular
letter Number 70/43. I shall quote the following sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I request that along the lines set out in the attached copy
the necessity for a firm but just treatment of the foreign
workers be made clear in a suitable manner to members of
the Party and the population.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This circular letter itself was issued by the Defendant Sauckel.
I now come to Document 025-PS, of 4 September 1942 and I read...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which number are you going to now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: 025-PS, dated 4 September 1942. I shall quote
the last sentence of the second paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Therefore, and this is also the opinion of the Reich Marshal
and of Reichsleiter Bormann, the problem of domestic workers
must be solved in a way different from that mentioned
above.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then I quote from Paragraph 3, starting with the second
sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In connection with this”—namely, the employment in Germany
of women workers from the East—“Reichsleiter Bormann
also agrees that members of the Armed Forces or other
agencies who have brought female domestic workers into the
Reich illegally will have their action subsequently approved;
approval of such action in the future will not be withheld,
regardless of the official recruiting scheme. The determining
factor in the recruiting of Ukrainian female workers is the
specific wish of the Führer that only girls whose conduct and
appearance permit a permanent stay in Germany should be
brought into the Reich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then I shall read from Figure 1, almost the last paragraph on
Page 3 of your document book:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Recruiting, especially in the case of domestic servants, must
be on a voluntary basis and must in practice be carried out
with the help of the offices of the Reichsführer SS.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This concludes my quotations from the document book of the
Prosecution, and I should like now to refer only to the Russian
Document USSR-172 and to Document Dönitz-91, of which I shall
make use in my final speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This, then, brings me to the end of the presentation of my
evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, may I suggest that if this witness
Kempka can be located, counsel might submit an affidavit or an
<span class='pageno' title='270' id='Page_270'></span>
interrogatory to any persons who have knowledge of the alleged
death of Defendant Bormann. We certainly would have no objection
to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I have no objection either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Bergold, have you any information as to
what this witness Kempka can tell us about the death of Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: According to the affidavit, which I read to the
Tribunal, he is said to have been present when Bormann was killed
by a tank explosion. He would, therefore, be an eye witness of Bormann’s
death, like the witness Rattenhuber, from whom the witness
Krüger obtained her information. If the witnesses Kempka and
Rattenhuber were found, I would be satisfied with affidavits and
interrogatories.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, I have seen this statement by Kempka
some time ago, which is in affidavit form and which has come to
our attention. But my recollection is that he does not state positively
that he saw him die. But I again suggest we might make further
efforts to get an affidavit from him, or an interrogatory, or carefully
question him about the circumstances of the death.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: A statement was made to the Tribunal at one
time by the Prosecution suggesting that Bormann had escaped from
the Chancellery in a tank and then the tank had been stopped or
blown up on a bridge and that two of the persons inside the tank
had last seen Bormann wounded, or something of that sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, I think that is the best information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dodd, if the Prosecution has any material
in the shape of affidavits or anything of that sort, the Tribunal
would like to have them placed before them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, Sir. I am sure we do not have an affidavit. As
I recall, it was last fall when someone sent down here what purported
to be a narrative account by Kempka of the last days in
Berlin. Now, I will try to look that up and present it to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you can go into the matter, then possibly
they might be located through the investigations which you would
make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then interrogatories or affidavits could be
obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Very well, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then that concludes your presentation of evidence
on behalf of Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: That is all I have, Mr. President.
<span class='pageno' title='271' id='Page_271'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Pokrovsky, is there anything you wish to say? I beg
your pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Bergold, you have offered in evidence all the exhibits that
you want to offer and have given them exhibit numbers, have you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, in my document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are intending to offer your document
book as evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It has exhibit numbers on each document,
has it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Yes, each document has a number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Colonel Pokrovsky, the Tribunal would like to know whether
you have arrived at any agreement with Dr. Stahmer on behalf of
the Defendant Göring with reference to affidavit evidence or witnesses,
with reference to the Katyn matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL Y. V. POKROVSKY (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the
U.S.S.R.): My Lord, we have had three conferences with the Defense
Counsel. After the second meeting I told the Tribunal that,
in order to shorten the proceedings, the Soviet Prosecution was
willing to read into the record only a part of the evidence submitted.
About 15 minutes ago I had a meeting with Dr. Exner and
Dr. Stahmer, and they told me that their understanding of the Tribunal’s
ruling was that the old decision for the summoning of two
witnesses was still in force and that only additional documents were
now under discussion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of this interpretation of the Tribunal’s ruling, I do not
think that we shall be able to come to an agreement with the
Defense. As I see it, the decision in this matter must now rest in
the hands of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal orders that, unless an agreement
is arrived at, the evidence shall not be given entirely by affidavits
and that the three witnesses on either side shall be called
first thing on Monday morning at 10 o’clock, unless you can arrive
at an agreement before that, that the evidence is to be offered in
affidavits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, may I say something on this
subject?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of counsel who are interested in the Katyn case had
a conference this morning; among them were Professor Exner and
Dr. Stahmer. We agreed to ask the Tribunal to allow two witnesses
<span class='pageno' title='272' id='Page_272'></span>
to be examined here in person by the Defense. These witnesses
would be Colonel Ahrens and First Lieutenant Von Eichborn. We
also agreed to dispense with the hearing of the third witness but
decided to request that an affidavit of this witness, and in addition
two other affidavits, be submitted. I believe this to be a suggestion
which both satisfies us and saves the most time: Two witnesses
would be heard and three affidavits submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, the Tribunal sees no objection
to there being two witnesses called and one affidavit. But their
order was that three witnesses on either side—that the evidence
should be limited to three witnesses on either side; and they, therefore,
are not prepared to allow further affidavits to be given. The
evidence must be confined to the evidence of three persons on either
side. They may give their evidence either by oral evidence or by
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, as far as I was informed, the original
decision stated that three witnesses were allowed but did not
mention affidavits. That was the reason why Dr. Stahmer and Professor
Exner assumed that, regardless of the witnesses, certain individual
points could be proved by means of affidavits. I think that
the hearing of two witnesses and three affidavits would be quicker
than the examination of three witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am afraid Dr. Stahmer and Dr. Exner drew
a wrong inference from the order of the Tribunal. The Tribunal
intended and intends that the evidence should be limited to the
evidence of three witnesses on either side, and whether they give
their evidence orally or by affidavit does not matter. We left it to
the Soviet Prosecution and to defendant’s counsel to see whether
they could agree that it should be given by affidavit in order to
save time. But that was not intended to extend the number of witnesses
who might give evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, in that case, I should be grateful
if Dr. Stahmer and Professor Exner would be heard. I myself have
not been in Nuremberg recently; I was therefore not present when
these details were discussed and it is difficult for me—I see that
Dr. Stahmer is now—perhaps Dr. Stahmer himself could speak
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have just heard Dr. Siemers’ report, at least a
part of it. I mentioned already during the last discussion, Mr. President,
that Professor Exner and I had understood the decision to
mean that besides the three witnesses we were also allowed to submit
affidavits. Indeed, the original decision granted us five witnesses,
though it made the reservation that only three of them
could give evidence here in Court. We assumed, therefore, that we
<span class='pageno' title='273' id='Page_273'></span>
could submit affidavits of those witnesses out of the five who had
been originally granted us but who would not give evidence in
Court. The original decision granted us five witnesses, and then a
later decision of the Tribunal...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Listen, that is not the recollection of the Tribunal;
and if you say so, you must produce written evidence that
that was the decision. The Tribunal’s recollection is not that five
witnesses were allowed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, yes, yes. I shall submit written evidence
of these decisions to the Tribunal. I cannot remember offhand
when they were made, but originally five witnesses were granted;
then I named another witness, who was also granted, and it was
only afterwards that the decision to allow only three witnesses to
give evidence in Court was announced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, when the order was made limiting
it to three out of five, there was no reference in that order to
affidavits, as far as I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No, affidavits were not mentioned then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What I am telling you is that the Tribunal
in making that order of limitation intended to limit the whole of
the evidence to three witnesses on either side, because the matter
is only a subsidiary allegation of fact; and the Tribunal thinks that
at this stage of the proceedings such an allegation of fact ought not
to be investigated by a great number of witnesses, and three witnesses
are quite sufficient on either side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore the Tribunal does not desire to hear and did not intend
that it should have to hear any evidence except the evidence of
three witnesses, either orally or by affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until Monday 1 July at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='274' id='Page_274'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SIXTY-EIGHTH DAY</span><br/> Monday, 1 July 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have an announcement to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal orders that any of the evidence taken on commission
which the Defense Counsel or the Prosecution wish to use
shall be offered in evidence by them. This evidence will then
become a part of the record, subject to any objections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Counsel for the organizations should begin to make up their
document books as soon as possible and put in their requests for
translations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: With reference to the events at Katyn, the Indictment
contains only the remark: “In September 1941, 11,000 Polish
officers, prisoners of war, were killed in the Katyn woods near
Smolensk.” The Russian Prosecution only submitted the details at
the session of 14 February 1946. Document USSR-54 was then
submitted to the Tribunal. This document is an official report by
the Extraordinary State Commission, which was officially authorized
to investigate the Katyn case. This commission, after questioning
the witnesses...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal are aware of the
document and they only want you to call your evidence; that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I wanted only to add, Mr. President, that according
to this document, there are two accusations: One, that the period
of the shooting of the Polish prisoners of war was the autumn of
1941; and the second assertion is, that the killing was carried out
by some German military authority, camouflaged under the name
of “Staff of Engineer Battalion 537.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is all in the document, is it not? I have
just told you we know the document. We only want you to call
your evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, as my first witness for the Defense, I shall
call Colonel Friedrich Ahrens to the witness stand.
<span class='pageno' title='275' id='Page_275'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I have a request to make before
the evidence is heard in the Katyn case. The Tribunal decided that
three witnesses should be heard, and it hinted that in the interests
of equality, the Prosecution could also produce only three witnesses,
either by means of direct examination or by means of an affidavit.
In the interests of that same principled equality, I should be grateful
if the Soviet Delegation, in the same way as the Defense, would
state the names of their witnesses before the hearing of the evidence.
The Defense submitted the names of their witnesses weeks ago. Unfortunately,
up to now, I note that in the interests of equality and
with regard to the treatment of the Defense and the Prosecution,
the Soviet Delegation has so far not given the names of the witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: General Rudenko, were you going to give me
the names of the witnesses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Yes, Mr. President. Today we notified the
General Secretary of the Tribunal that the Soviet Prosecution
intends to call three witnesses to the stand: Professor Prosorovski,
who is the Chief of the Medico-Legal Experts Commission; the Bulgarian
subject, Professor of Legal Medicine at Sofia University
Markov, who at the same time was a member of the so-called
International Commission created by the Germans; and Professor
Bazilevsky, who was the deputy mayor of Smolensk during the time
of the German occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Ahrens took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FRIEDRICH AHRENS (Witness): Friedrich Ahrens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, did you, as a professional officer in the
German Armed Forces, participate in the second World War?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, of course; as a professional officer I participated
in the second World War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What rank did you hold finally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: At the end as colonel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you stationed in the eastern theater of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='276' id='Page_276'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In what capacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I was the commanding officer of a signal regiment of
an army group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What were the tasks of your regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: The signal regiment of an army group had the task of
setting up and maintaining communications between the army
group and the neighboring units and subordinate units, as well as
preparing the necessary lines of communication for new operations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did your regiment have any special tasks apart
from that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, with the exception of the duty of defending
themselves, of taking all measures to hinder a sudden attack and
of holding themselves in readiness to defend themselves with the
forces at their disposal, so as to prevent the capture of the regimental
battle headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was particularly important for an army group signal regiment
and its battle headquarters because we had to keep a lot of
highly secret material in our staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Your regiment was the Signal Regiment 537.
Was there also an Engineer Battalion 537, the same number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: During the time when I was in the Army Group Center
I heard of no unit with the same number, nor do I believe that
there was such a unit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And to whom were you subordinated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I was directly subordinated to the staff of the Army
Group Center, and that was the case during the entire period when
I was with the army group. My superior was General Oberhäuser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to defense, the signal staff of the regiment with its
first battalion, which was in close touch with the regimental staff,
was at times subordinated to the commander of Smolensk; all
orders which I received from that last-named command came via
General Oberhäuser, who either approved or refused to allow the
regiment to be employed for a particular purpose.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In other words, I received my orders exclusively from General
Oberhäuser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where was your staff accommodated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I prepared a sketch of the position of the staff headquarters
west of Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I am having the sketch shown to you. Please
tell us whether that is your sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That sketch was drawn by me from memory.
<span class='pageno' title='277' id='Page_277'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I am now going to have a second sketch shown
to you. Will you please have a look at that one also, and will you
tell me whether it presents a correct picture of the situation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: May I briefly explain this sketch to you? At the right-hand
margin, that large red spot is the town of Smolensk. West of
Smolensk, and on either side of the road to Vitebsk, the staff of the
army group was situated together with the Air Force corps, that
is south of Krasnibor. On my sketch I have marked the actual area
occupied by the Army Group Center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That part of my sketch which has a dark line around it was
very densely occupied by troops who came directly under the army
group; there was hardly a house empty in that area.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The regimental staff of my regiment was in the so-called little
Katyn wood. That is the white spot which is indicated on the sketch;
it measures about 1 square kilometer of the large forest and is a
part of the entire forest around Katyn. On the southern edge of
this small wood there lay the so-called Dnieper Castle, which was
the regimental staff headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Two and a half kilometers to the east of the staff headquarters
of the regiment there was the first company of the regiment, which
was the operating company, which did teleprinting and telephone
work for the army group. About 3 kilometers west of the regimental
staff headquarters there was the wireless company. There
were no buildings within the radius of about 1 kilometer of the
regimental staff headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This house was a large two-story building with about 14 to
15 rooms, several bath installations, a cinema, a rifle range, garages,
Sauna (steam baths) and so on, and was most suitable for accommodating
the regimental staff. Our regiment permanently retained
this battle headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were there also any other high-ranking staff
headquarters nearby?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: As higher staff headquarters there was the army
group, which I have already mentioned, then a corps staff from the
Air Force, and several battalion staffs. Then there was the delegate
of the railway for the army group, who was at Gnesdovo in a
special train.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It has been stated in this Trial that certain
events which have taken place in your neighborhood had been most
secret and most suspicious. Will you please, therefore, answer the
following questions with particular care?</p>

<p class='pindent'>How many Germans were there in the staff personnel, and what
positions did they fill?
<span class='pageno' title='278' id='Page_278'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I had 3 officers on my staff to begin with, and then
2, and approximately 18 to 20 noncommissioned officers and men;
that is to say, as few as I could have in my regimental staff, and
every man in the staff was fully occupied.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you have Russian personnel in your staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, we had four auxiliary volunteers and some
female personnel living in the immediate vicinity of the regimental
staff quarters. The auxiliary volunteers remained permanently with
the regimental staff, whereas the female personnel changed from
time to time. Some of these women also came from Smolensk and
they lived in a separate building near the regimental staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did this Russian personnel receive special instructions
from you about their conduct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I issued general instructions on conduct for the regimental
headquarters, which did not solely apply to the Russian
personnel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already mentioned the importance of secrecy with
reference to this regimental headquarters, which not only kept the
records of the position of the army group, but also that of its neighboring
units, and on which the intentions of the army group were
clearly recognizable. Therefore, it was my duty to keep this
material particularly secret. Consequently, I had the rooms containing
this material barred to ordinary access. Only those persons
were admitted—generally officers—who had been passed by me, but
also a few noncommissioned officers and other ranks who were put
under special oath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: To which rooms did this “no admission” order
refer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: In the first place, it referred to the telephone expert’s
room, it also referred to my own room and partly, although to a
smaller degree, to the adjutant’s room. All remaining rooms in the
house and on the site were not off limits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, how is this evidence about the
actual conditions in these staff headquarters relevant to this
question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, in the Russian document the allegation
is contained that events of a particularly secret nature had
taken place in this staff building and that a ban of silence had
been imposed on the Russian personnel by Colonel Ahrens, that the
rooms had been locked, and that one was only permitted to enter
the rooms when accompanied by guards. I have put the questions
in this connection in order to clear up the case and to prove that
these events have a perfectly natural explanation on account of the
<span class='pageno' title='279' id='Page_279'></span>
tasks entrusted to the regiment and which necessitated quite obviously,
a certain amount of secrecy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For that reason, I have put these questions. May I be permitted...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have almost finished with these questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Was the Katyn wood cordoned off, and
especially strictly guarded by soldiers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, may I remark with reference to this question that
here also it had been alleged that this cordon had only been introduced
by the regiment. Previously, there had been free access
to the woods, and from this conclusions are drawn which are detrimental
to the regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: In order to secure antiaircraft cover for the regimental
staff headquarters, I stopped any timber from being cut for
fuel in the immediate vicinity of the regimental staff headquarters.
During this winter the situation was such that the units cut wood
wherever they could get it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 22 January, there was a fairly heavy air attack on my
position during which half a house was torn away. It was quite
impossible to find any other accommodation because of the overcrowding
of the area, and I therefore took additional precautions to
make sure that this already fairly thin wood would be preserved
so as to serve as cover. Since, on the other hand, I am against the
putting up of prohibition signs, I asked the other troop units by
way of verses to leave us our trees as antiaircraft cover. The wood
was not closed off at all, particularly as the road had to be kept
open for heavy traffic, and I only sent sentries now and then into
the wood to see whether our trees were left intact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The Prosecution...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, at a time that is convenient to
you, you will, of course, draw our attention to the necessary dates,
the date at which this unit took over its headquarters and the date
at which it left.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] When did your unit, your regiment,
move into this Dnieper Castle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: As far as I know, this house was taken over immediately
after the combat troops had left that area in August 1941,
and it was confiscated together with the other army group accommodations,
and was occupied by advance parties. It was then permanently
occupied by the regimental headquarters as long as I was
there up to August 1943.
<span class='pageno' title='280' id='Page_280'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: So, if I understand you correctly, it was first of
all in August 1941 that an advance party took it over?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, as far as I know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When did the staff actually arrive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: A few weeks later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Who was the regimental commander at that
time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: My predecessor was Colonel Bedenck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When did you take over the regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I joined the army group during the second half of
November 1941, and after getting thoroughly acquainted with all
details I took over the command of the regiment, at the end of
November, if I remember rightly, on 30 November.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was there a proper handing over from Bedenck
to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: A very careful, detailed, and lengthy transfer took
place, on account of the very considerable tasks entrusted to this
regiment. Added to that, my superior, General Oberhäuser, was an
extraordinarily painstaking superior, and he took great pains to
convince himself personally whether, by the transfer negotiations
and the instructions which I had received, I was fully capable of
taking over the responsibilities of the regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The Prosecution further alleges and claims that
it was suspicious that shots were often fired in the forest. Is that
true, and to what would you attribute that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I have already mentioned that it was one of the main
tasks of the regiment to take all the necessary measures to defend
themselves against sudden attack. Considering the small number
of men which I had in my regimental staff, I had to organize and
take the necessary steps to enable me to obtain replacements in the
shortest time possible. This was arranged through wireless communication
with the regimental headquarters. I ordered that defensive
maneuvers should be carried out and that defense works should
be prepared around the regimental headquarters sector and that
there should be maneuvers and exercises in these works together
with the members of the regimental headquarters. I personally
participated in these maneuvers at times and, of course, shots were
fired, particularly since we were preparing ourselves for night
fighting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: There is supposed to have been a very lively
and rather suspicious traffic to and around your staff building.
Will you please tell us quite briefly what this traffic signified?
<span class='pageno' title='281' id='Page_281'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: There was an extraordinary lively traffic around staff
headquarters which still increased in the spring of 1941 as I was
having the house rebuilt. I think I mentioned that it had been
destroyed through air attacks. But, of course, the traffic increased
also through the maneuvers which were held nearby. The battalions
in the front area operating at 300 and 400 kilometers distance had
to, and could perform their job only by maintaining personal contact
with the regiment and its staff headquarters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: There is supposed to have been considerable
truck traffic which has been described as suspicious.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Besides our supplies, which were relatively small, the
Kommandos, as I have just mentioned, were brought in by trucks;
but so was, of course, all the building material which I required.
Apart from that, the traffic was not unusually heavy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that about 25 kilometers west of
Smolensk there were three Russian prisoner-of-war camps, which
had originally been inhabited by Poles and which had been abandoned
by the Russians when the German troops approached in July
1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: At that time I had not yet arrived. But never during
the entire period I served in Russia did I see a single Pole; nor
did I hear of Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It has been alleged that an order had been issued
from Berlin according to which Polish prisoners of war were to be
shot. Did you know of such an order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No. I have never heard of such an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you possibly receive such an order from any
other office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I told you already that I never heard of such an order
and I therefore did not receive it, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were any Poles shot on your instructions, your
direct instructions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No Poles were shot on my instructions. Nobody at all
was ever shot upon my order. I have never given such an order
in all my life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Well, you did not arrive until November 1941.
Have you heard anything about your predecessor, Colonel Bedenck,
having given any similar orders?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I have not heard anything about it. With my regimental
staff, with whom I lived closely together for 21 months, I
had such close connections, I knew my people so well, and they also
<span class='pageno' title='282' id='Page_282'></span>
knew me, that I am perfectly convinced that this deed was not perpetrated
by my predecessor nor by any member of my former regiment.
I would undoubtedly have heard rumors of it at the very
least.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: This is argument, you know, Dr. Stahmer.
This is not evidence; it is argument. He is telling you what he thinks
might have been the case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I asked whether he had heard of it from members
of his regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The answer to that would be “no,” I suppose,
that he had not heard—not that he was convinced that he had not
done it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] After your arrival at Katyn, did you
notice that there was a grave mound in the woods at Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Shortly after I arrived—the ground was covered by
snow—one of my soldiers pointed out to me that at a certain spot
there was some sort of a mound, which one could hardly describe
as such, on which there was a birch cross. I have seen that birch
cross. In the course of 1942 my soldiers kept telling me that here
in our woods shootings were supposed to have taken place, but at
first I did not pay any attention to it. However, in the summer of
1942 this topic was referred to in an order of the army group later
commanded by General Von Harsdorff. He told me that he had
also heard about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did these stories prove true later on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, they did turn out to be true and I was able to
confirm, quite by accident, that there was actually a grave here.
During the winter of 1943—I think either January or February—quite
accidentally I saw a wolf in this wood and at first I did not
believe that it was a wolf; when I followed the tracks with an
expert, we saw that there were traces of scratchings on the mound
with the cross. I had investigations made as to what kind of bones
these were. The doctors told me “human bones.” Thereupon I informed
the officer responsible for war graves in the area of this
fact, because I believed that it was a soldier’s grave, as there were
a number of such graves in our immediate vicinity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, how did the exhumation take place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I do not know about all the details. Professor Dr. Butz
arrived one day on orders from the army group, and informed me
that following the rumors in my little wood, he had to make exhumations,
and that he had to inform me that these exhumations
would take place in my wood.
<span class='pageno' title='283' id='Page_283'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did Professor Butz later give you details of the
result of his exhumations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, he did occasionally give me details and I remember
that he told me that he had conclusive evidence regarding
the date of the shootings. Among other things, he showed me letters,
of which I cannot remember much now; but I do remember some
sort of a diary which he passed over to me in which there were
dates followed by some notes which I could not read because they
were written in Polish. In this connection he explained to me that
these notes had been made by a Polish officer regarding events
of the past months, and that at the end—the diary ended with the
spring of 1940—the fear was expressed in these notes that something
horrible was going to happen. I am giving only a broad outline
of the meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did he give you any further indication regarding
the period he assumed the shooting had taken place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Professor Butz, on the basis of the proofs which he
had found, was convinced that the shootings had taken place in the
spring of 1940 and I often heard him express these convictions in
my presence, and also later on, when commissions visited the grave
and I had to place my house at the disposal of these commissions
to accommodate them. I personally did not have anything to do
whatsoever with the exhumations or with the commissions. All I
had to do was to place the house at their disposal and act as host.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It was alleged that in March 1943 lorries had
transported bodies to Katyn from outside and these bodies were
buried in the little wood. Do you know anything about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I know nothing about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Would you have had to take notice of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I would have had to take notice of it—at least my
officers would have reported it to me, because my officers were
constantly at the regimental battle headquarters, whereas I, as a
regimental commander, was of course, frequently on the way. The
officer who in those days was there constantly was First Lieutenant
Hodt, whose address I got to know last night from a letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were Russian prisoners of war used for these
exhumations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: As far as I remember, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell us the number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I cannot say exactly as I did not concern myself any
further with these exhumations on account of the dreadful and
revolting stench around our house, but I should estimate the number
as being about 40 to 50 men.
<span class='pageno' title='284' id='Page_284'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It has been alleged that they were shot afterward;
have you any knowledge of that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I have no knowledge of that and I also never heard
of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER OTTO KRANZBÜHLER (Counsel for Defendant
Dönitz): Colonel, did you yourself ever discuss the events of
1940 with any of the local inhabitants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes. At the beginning of 1943 a Russian married couple
were living near my regimental headquarters; they lived 800 meters
away and they were beekeepers. I, too, kept bees, and I came into
close contact with this married couple. When the exhumations had
been completed, approximately in May 1943, I told them that, after
all, they ought to know when these shootings had taken place, since
they were living in close proximity to the graves. Thereupon, these
people told me it had occurred in the spring of 1940, and that at the
Gnesdovo station more than 200 Poles in uniform had arrived in
railway trucks of 50 tons each and were then taken to the woods in
lorries. They had heard lots of shots and screams, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Was the wood off limits
to the local inhabitants at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: We have...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is a leading question. I do not think
you should ask leading questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Do you know whether
the local inhabitants could enter the woods at the time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: There was a fence around the wood and according to
the statements of the local inhabitants, civilians could not enter it
during the time the Russians were there. The remains of the fence
were still visible when I was there, and this fence is indicated on
my sketch and is marked with a black line.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: When you moved into
Dnieper Castle did you make inquiries as to who the former owners
were?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, I did make inquiries because I was interested.
The house was built in a rather peculiar way. It had a cinema
installation and its own rifle range and of course that interested me;
but I failed to ascertain anything definite during the whole time
I was there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Apart from mass graves
in the neighborhood of the castle, were there any other graves found?
<span class='pageno' title='285' id='Page_285'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I have indicated by a few dots on my sketch, that in
the vicinity of the castle there were found a number of other small
graves which contained decayed bodies; that is to say, skeletons
which had disintegrated. These graves contained perhaps six, eight,
or a few more male and female skeletons. Even I, a layman, could
recognize that very clearly, because most of them had rubber shoes
on which were in good condition, and there were also remains of
handbags.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: How long had these
skeletons been in the ground?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That I cannot tell you. I know only that they were
decayed and had disintegrated. The bones were preserved, but the
skeleton structure was no longer intact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Thank you, that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANS LATERNSER (Counsel for General Staff and High
Command of the German Armed Forces): Mr. President...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Laternser, you know the Tribunal’s
ruling.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you have no right to ask any questions
of the witness here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I just wanted to ask you, in
this unusual case, to allow me to put questions...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I said to you that you know the Tribunal’s
ruling and the Tribunal will not hear you. We have already ruled
upon this once or twice in consequence of your objections and the
Tribunal will not hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, the Katyn case is one of the
most serious accusations raised against the group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal is perfectly well aware of the
nature of the allegations about Katyn and the Tribunal does not
propose to make any exceptional rule in that case and it therefore
will not hear you and you will kindly sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I wish to state that on account
of this ruling I feel myself unduly handicapped in my defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: As Dr. Laternser knows perfectly well, he is
entitled to apply to the Commission to call any witness who is
called here, if his evidence bears upon the case of the particular
organizations for which Dr. Laternser appears. I do not want to
hear anything further.
<span class='pageno' title='286' id='Page_286'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, the channel you point out to
me is of no practical importance. I cannot have every witness who
appears here called by the Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, you are appearing for the
Defendant Dönitz, or is it Raeder?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Defendant Raeder.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, unless the questions you are going to
ask particularly refer to the case of the Defendant Raeder, the
Tribunal is not prepared to hear any further examination. The
matter has been generally covered by Dr. Stahmer and also by
Dr. Kranzbühler. Therefore, unless the questions which you want
to ask have some particular reference to the case of Raeder, the
Tribunal will not hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I had merely assumed that there
were two reasons on the strength of which I could put a few questions:
First, because the Tribunal itself has stated that within the
framework of the conspiracy all defendants had been participants;
and second, that according to the statements by the Prosecution
Grossadmiral Raeder, too, is considered a member of the alleged
criminal organizations, the General Staff and the OKW. It was for
that reason I wanted to ask one or two supplementary questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, if there were any allegations
that in any way bore on the case against Defendant Raeder, the
Tribunal would of course allow you to ask questions; but there is
no allegation which in any way connects the Defendant Raeder
with the allegations about the Katyn woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I am grateful to the Tribunal for that statement,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, may I be allowed to ask something
else? May I have the question put to the Prosecution, who is
to be made responsible for the Katyn case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not propose to answer questions of
that sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution may now cross-examine if they want to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>CHIEF COUNSELLOR OF JUSTICE L. N. SMIRNOV (Assistant
Prosecutor for the U.S.S.R.): Please tell me, Witness, since when,
exactly, have you been in the Smolensk district territory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I have already answered that question: since the
second half of November 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer me further, where
were you prior to the second part of 1941? Did you in any way have
anything to do with Katyn or Smolensk or this district in general?
Were you there personally in September and October 1941?
<span class='pageno' title='287' id='Page_287'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say that you were
not there, either in September or in October 1941, and therefore do
not know what happened at that time in the Katyn forest?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I was not there at that time, but I mentioned earlier
on that...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am actually only interested
in a short question. Were you there personally or not? Were
you able to see for yourself what was happening there or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He says he was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I was not there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He said he was not there in September or
October 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Maybe you recall the family names of
the Russian women workers who were employed at the country
house in the woods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Those female workers were not working in different
houses. They merely worked as auxiliary kitchen personnel in our
Dnieper Castle. I have not known their names at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That means that the Russian
women workers were employed only in the villa situated in Katyn
forest where the staff headquarters were located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I believe that question was not translated well. I did
not understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked you whether the Russian
women workers were employed exclusively in the villa in Kosig
Gory where the staff headquarters were located? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: The women workers worked for the regimental headquarters
as kitchen help, and as kitchen helpers they worked on
our premises; and by our premises I mean this particular house
with the adjoining houses—for instance, the stables, the garage, the
cellars, the boiler room.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will mention a few names of
German military employees. Will you please tell me whether they
belonged to your unit? First Lieutenant Rex?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: First Lieutenant Rex was my regimental adjutant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me, was he already
assigned to that unit before your arrival at Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, he was there before I came.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He was your adjutant, was he not?
<span class='pageno' title='288' id='Page_288'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, he was my adjutant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Lieutenant Hodt? Hodt or Hoth?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Lieutenant Hodt is right; but what question are you
putting about Lieutenant Hodt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am only questioning you about
whether he belonged to your unit or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Lieutenant Hodt was a member of the regiment.
Whether...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is what I was asking.
He belonged to the regiment which you commanded, to your army
unit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I did not say by that that he was a member of the
regimental staff, but that he belonged to the regiment. The regiment
consisted of three units.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But he lived in the same villa,
did he not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That I do not know. When I arrived he was not there.
I ordered him to report to me there for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will enumerate a few other
names. Corporal Rose, Private Giesecken, Oberfeldwebel Krimmenski,
Feldwebel Lummert, a cook named Gustav. Were these
members of the Armed Forces who were billeted in the villa?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: May I ask you to mention the names individually once
again, and I will answer you individually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Feldwebel Lummert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Corporal Rose?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And I believe, if my memory
serves me correctly, Storekeeper Giesecke.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That man’s name was Giesecken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is right. I did not
pronounce this name quite correctly. These were all your people or
at least they belonged to your unit, did they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you assert that you did not
know what these people were doing in September and October 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: As I was not there, I cannot tell you for certain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='289' id='Page_289'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I continue? Mr. President,
since the witness has stated that he cannot give any testimony concerning
the period of September to October 1941, I will limit myself
to very short questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Witness, would you please point out the
location of the villa and the forest with respect to the Smolensk-Vitebsk
highway? Did the estate cover a large area?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: My sketch is on a scale of 1 to 100,000 and is drawn
from memory. I estimate, therefore, that the graves were situated
200 to 300 meters directly west of the road to our Dnieper Castle,
and 200 to 300 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk road so that
the Dnieper Castle lay a further 600 meters away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: South of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, approximately
15 kilometers west of Smolensk. According to the scale 1 to
100,000, as far as one is able to draw such a sketch accurately from
memory, the site of these graves was 200 to 300 meters to the south,
and a further 600 meters to the south, directly on the northern bend
of the Dnieper, was situated our regimental staff quarters, the
Dnieper Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the villa was
approximately 600 meters away from the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, that is not correct. What I said...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please give a more or less exact
figure. What was the distance between the highway and the villa,
please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I just mentioned it in my testimony, that is to say,
the graves were about 200 to 300 meters away, and there were a
further 600 meters to the castle, therefore, in all about 900 to 1,000
meters. It might have been 800 meters, but that is the approximate
distance as can also be seen by this sketch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I am not following this. Your question,
Colonel Smirnov, was: How far was it from the road to what you
called the country house? Was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President, I asked how
far was the villa from the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What do you mean by the “Villa”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The headquarters of the unit
commanded by the witness in 1941 was quartered in a villa, and this
villa was situated not far from the Dnieper River, at a distance of
about 900 meters from the highroad. The graves were nearer to the
<span class='pageno' title='290' id='Page_290'></span>
highway. I would like to know how far away were the headquarters
from the highway, and how far away from the highway were
the graves in Katyn forest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What you want to know is: How far was the
house in which the headquarters was situated from the highway?
Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is exactly what I
wanted to know, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: You put two questions to me: first of all, how far
were the graves from the highway; and secondly, how far was the
house from the highway. I will repeat the answer once more, the
house was 800 to 1,000 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk
highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One minute, please. I asked you
primarily only about the house. Your answer concerning the graves
was given on your own initiative. Now I will ask you about the
graves, how far were these mass graves from the Smolensk-Vitebsk
highway?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: From 200 to 300 meters. It might also have been
350 meters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the graves were
200 or 300 meters from the main road which connected two important
centers? Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, indeed. They were at a distance of 200 to 300
meters south of this, and I may say that at my time this was the
most frequented road I ever saw in Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That was just what I was asking
you. Now, please tell me: Was the Katyn wood a real forest, or
was it, rather, a park or a grove?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Up to now I have only spoken about the wood of
Katyn. This wood of Katyn is the fenced-in wooded area of about
1 square kilometer, which I drew in my sketch. This wood is of
mixed growth, of older and younger trees. There were many birch
trees in this little wood. However, there were clearings in this
wood, and I should say that from 30 to 40 percent was cleared. One
could see this from the stumps of newly felled trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under no circumstances could you describe this wood as a park;
at any rate one could not come to such a conclusion. Fighting had
taken place in this wood, as one could still see trenches and fox holes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but anyway, you would not
call Katyn wood a real forest since it was relatively a small grove
in the immediate vicinity of the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway. Is
that right?
<span class='pageno' title='291' id='Page_291'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, that is not right. It was a forest. The entire
Katyn forest was a regular forest which began near our grove and
extended far beyond that. Of this Katyn forest, which was a mixed
forest, part of it had been fenced in, and this part, extending over
1 square kilometer, was what we called the little Katyn wood, but
it did belong to this entire wooded region south of the highway.
The forest began with our little wood and extended to the west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am not interested in the general
characteristics of the wood. I would like you to answer the
following short question: Were the mass graves located in this
grove?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: The mass graves were situated directly west of our
entrance drive in a clearing in the wood, where there was a growth
of young trees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, but this clearing, this
growth of young trees, was located inside this small grove, near
the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway, is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: It was 200 to 300 meters south of the Smolensk-Vitebsk
highway, and directly west of the entrance drive leading
from this road to the Dnieper Castle. I have marked this spot on
my sketch with a fairly large white dot.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One more question. As far as
you know did the Smolensk-Vitebsk highway exist before the German
occupation of Smolensk, or was it constructed only after the
occupation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: When I arrived in Russia at the end of November
1941, everything was covered with snow. Later I got the impression
that this was an old road, whereas the road Minsk-Moscow was
newer. That was my impression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand. Now tell me,
under what circumstances, or rather, when did you first discover
the cross in the grove?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I cannot tell the exact date. My soldiers told me
about it, and on one occasion when I was going past there, about
the beginning of January 1942—it could also have been at the end
of December 1941—I saw this cross rising above the snow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This means you saw it already
in 1941 or at the latest the beginning of 1942?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That is what I have just testified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, certainly. Now, please be
more specific concerning the date when a wolf brought you to this
cross. Was it in winter or summer and what year?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: It was the beginning of 1943.
<span class='pageno' title='292' id='Page_292'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In 1943? And around the cross
you saw bones, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, at first I did not see them. In order to find out
whether I had not been mistaken about seeing a wolf, for it seemed
rather impossible that a wolf should be so near to Smolensk, I examined
the tracks together with a gamekeeper and found traces of
scratching on the ground. However, the ground was frozen hard,
there was snow on the ground and I did not see anything further
there. Only later on, after it had been thawing my men found
various bones. However, this was months later and then, at a suitable
opportunity I showed these bones to a doctor and he said that
these were human bones. Thereupon I said, “Then most likely it
is a grave, left as a result of the fighting which has taken place
here,” and that the war graves registration officer would have to
take care of the graves in the same way in which we were taking
care of other graves of fallen soldiers. That was the reason why
I spoke to this gentleman—but only after the snow had melted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: By the way, did you personally
see the Katyn graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Open or before they were opened?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Open, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: When they were open I had constantly to drive past
these graves, as generally they were approximately 30 meters away
from the entrance drive. Therefore, I could hardly go past without
taking any notice of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am interested in the following:
Do you remember what the depth of the layer of earth was, which
covered the mass of human bodies in these graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That I do not know. I have already said that I was
so nauseated by the stench which we had to put up with for several
weeks, that when I drove past I closed the windows of my car and
rushed through as fast as I could.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: However, even if you only casually
glanced at those graves, perhaps you noticed whether the
layer of earth covering the corpses was deep or shallow? Was it
several centimeters or several meters deep? Maybe Professor Butz
told you something about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: As commander of a signal regiment I was concerned
with a region which was almost half as large as Greater Germany
and I was on the road a great deal. My work was not entirely carried
out at the regimental battle headquarters. Therefore, in
<span class='pageno' title='293' id='Page_293'></span>
general, from Monday or Tuesday until Saturday I was with my
units. For that reason, when I drove through, I did cast an occasional
glance at these graves; but I was not especially interested in
the details and I did not speak to Professor Butz about such details.
For this reason I have only a faint recollection of this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: According to the material submitted
to the High Tribunal by the Soviet Prosecution, it has been
established that the bodies were buried at a depth of 1½ to 2 meters.
I wonder where you met a wolf who could scratch the ground up
to a depth of 2 meters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I did not meet this wolf, but I saw it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me please, why you started
the exhumation on these mass graves in March 1943 only, after
having discovered the cross and learned about the mass graves
already in 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: That was not my concern, but a matter for the army
group. I have already told you that in the course of 1942 the stories
became more substantial. I frequently heard about them and spoke
about it to Colonel Von Gersdorff, Chief of Intelligence, Army Group
Center, who intimated to me that he knew all about this matter
and with that my obligation ended. I had reported what I had seen
and heard. Apart from that, all this matter did not concern me
and I did not concern myself with it. I had enough worries of
my own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And now the last question. Please
tell me who were these two persons with whom you had this conversation,
and maybe you can recollect the names of the couple who
told you about the shootings in the Katyn woods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: This couple lived in a small house about 800 to 1,000
meters north of the entrance to our drive leading to the Vitebsk
road. I do not recall their names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you do not remember the
names of this couple?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I do not recall the names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you heard about the Katyn
events from a couple whose names you do not remember, and you
did not hear anything about it from other local inhabitants?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Please repeat the question for me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, you heard about
these Katyn events only from this couple, whose names you do not
remember? From none of the other local inhabitants did you hear
anything about the events in Katyn?
<span class='pageno' title='294' id='Page_294'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I personally heard the facts only from this couple,
whereas my soldiers told me the stories current among the other
inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know that during the
investigation of the Katyn affair, or rather of the Katyn provocation,
posters were placarded by the German Police in the streets of
Smolensk, promising a reward to anyone giving any information in
connection with the Katyn event? It was signed by Lieutenant Voss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I personally did not see that poster. Lieutenant Voss
is known to me by name only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And the very last question. Do
you know of the report of the Extraordinary State Commission concerning
Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Do you mean the Russian <span class='it'>White Paper</span> when you mention
this report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I mean the report of the
Soviet Extraordinary State Commission, concerning Katyn, the
Soviet report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes, I read that report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, you are acquainted
with the fact that the Extraordinary State Commission names you
as being one of the persons responsible for the crimes committed in
Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: It mentions a Lieutenant Colonel Arnes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, do you wish to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, just a little while ago you said that
you did not know when First Lieutenant Hodt joined your staff. Do
you know when he joined the regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I know that he belonged to the regiment during the
Russian campaign and actually right from the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: That is, he belonged to the regiment from the
beginning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Yes. He belonged to this regiment ever since the beginning
of the Russian campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Just one more question dealing with your discussion
with Professor Butz. Did Professor Butz mention anything
about the last dates on the letters which he found?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: He told me about the spring of 1940. He also showed
me this diary and I looked at it and I also saw the dates, but I do
<span class='pageno' title='295' id='Page_295'></span>
not recall in detail just which date or dates they were. But they
ended with the spring of 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Therefore no documents were found of a later
date?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: Professor Butz told me that no documents or notes
were found which might have given indications of a later date, and
he expressed his conviction that these shootings must have taken
place in the spring of 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I have no further questions to put
to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Witness, can you not remember
exactly when Professor Butz discussed with you the date at
which the corpses were buried in the mass graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: May I ask to have the question repeated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): When did Professor Butz
speak to you about the mass graves and assert that the burial of
the corpses must have taken place in the spring of 1940?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I cannot tell you the date exactly, but it was in the
spring of 1943, before these exhumations had started—I beg your
pardon—he told me that he had been instructed to undertake the
exhumation and during the exhumations he was with me from time
to time; therefore it may have been in May or the end of April.
In the middle of May he gave me details of his exhumations and
told me among other things that which I have testified here. I
cannot now tell you exactly on which days Professor Butz visited me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): So far as I can remember,
you stated that Professor Butz arrived in Katyn. When did he
actually arrive there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: In the spring of 1940 Professor Butz came to me and
told me that on instructions of the army group, he was to undertake
exhumations in my woods. The exhumations were started, and
in the course of...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You say 1940? Or perhaps
the translation is wrong?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: 1943, in the spring of 1943. A few weeks after the
beginning of the exhumations, Professor Butz visited me, when I
happened to be there, and informed me; or, rather, he discussed
this matter with me, and he told me that to which I have testified
here. It may have been the middle of May 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): According to your testimony,
I understood you to say in answer to a question put by the
defense counsel, that Professor Butz asserted that the shootings
<span class='pageno' title='296' id='Page_296'></span>
had taken place in the spring of 1940 before the arrival of the commission
for the exhumations. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: May I repeat once more that Professor Butz...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): It is not necessary to repeat
what you have already said. I am only asking you, is it correct or
not? Maybe the translation was incorrect, or maybe your testimony
was incorrect at the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: I did not understand the question just put to me.
That is the reason why I wanted to explain this once more. I do
not know just what is meant by this last question. May I ask this
question be repeated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): At the beginning, when you
were interrogated by the defense counsel, I understood you to say
that Professor Butz told you that the shooting had taken place in
the spring of 1940, that is before the arrival of the commission for
the exhumations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, that has not been understood correctly. I testified
that Professor Butz came to me and told me that he was to
make exhumations since it concerned my woods. These exhumations
then took place, and approximately 6 to 8 weeks later Professor
Butz came to me—of course, he visited me on other occasions as
well—but approximately 6 to 8 weeks later he came to me and told
me that he was convinced that, as a result of his discoveries, he was
now able to fix the date of the shootings. This statement which he
made to me, refers approximately to the middle of May.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): Were you present when
the diary and the other documents which were shown to you by
Professor Butz were found?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Gen. Nikitchenko): You do not know where
he found the diary and other documents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, that I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When did you first report to superior authority
the fact that you suspected that there was a grave there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: At first, I was not suspicious. I have already mentioned
that fighting had taken place there; and at first I did not
attach any importance to the stories told to me and did not give
this matter any credence. I believed that it was a question of soldiers
who had been killed there—of war graves, like several in the
vicinity.
<span class='pageno' title='297' id='Page_297'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are not answering my question. I am
asking you, when did you first report to superior authority that
there was a grave there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: In the course of the summer 1942 I spoke to Colonel
Von Gersdorff about these stories which had come to my knowledge.
Gersdorff told me that he had heard that too, and that ended my
conversation with Von Gersdorff. He did not believe it to be true;
in any case he was not thoroughly convinced. That I do not know,
however.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in the spring of 1943, when the snow had melted, the bones
which had been found there were brought to me, and I then telephoned
to the officer in charge of war graves and told him that
apparently there were some soldiers’ graves here. That was before
Professor Butz had visited me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you make any report in writing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I did not do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Never?</p>

<p class='pindent'>AHRENS: No, I was not in any way concerned with this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, as another witness, I should like to call
Lieutenant Reinhard von Eichborn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Von Eichborn took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you state your full name please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>REINHARD VON EICHBORN (Witness): Reinhard von Eichborn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, what is your occupation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Assistant judge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you called up for service in the German
Armed Forces during this war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Yes, in August 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And what was your unit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Army Group Signal Regiment 537.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And what was your rank?
<span class='pageno' title='298' id='Page_298'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: At the outbreak of the war, platoon leader
and lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And at the end?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: First lieutenant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you on the Eastern Front during the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Yes, from the beginning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: With your regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: No, from 1940 onward, on the staff of Army
Group Center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Apart from this Regiment 537, was there an
Engineer Battalion 537?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: In the sphere of the Army Group Center
there was no Engineer Battalion 537.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When did you arrive with your unit in the
vicinity of Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: About 20 September the staff of Army Group
Center transferred its headquarters to Smolensk, that is to say in
the Smolensk region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where had you been stationed before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: How am I to understand this question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where did you come from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: We came from Borisov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. The witness said 20 September.
That does not identify the year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In what year was this 20 September?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: 20 September 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was Regiment 537 already there at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The staff of Regiment 537 was transferred at
about the same time together with the staff of the army group to
the place where the headquarters of the army group was. Advance
units had already been stationed there previously, in order to set
up communication facilities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And where was this staff accommodated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The staff of Army Group Signal Regiment 537
was accommodated in the so-called Dnieper Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where was the advance unit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The advance unit may have occupied this
building, too—or at least a part of this advance unit did—to safeguard
this building for the regimental staff.
<span class='pageno' title='299' id='Page_299'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know who was in command of this
advance unit?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Lieutenant Hodt was in command of this
advance unit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When did this advance unit come to Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Smolensk fell on about 17 July 1941. The
army group had planned to put up its headquarters in the immediate
vicinity of Smolensk, and, after this group had selected its
quarters, this region was seized immediately after the fall of the
city. The advance unit arrived at the same time as this area was
seized, and that was probably in the second half of July of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Therefore the advance unit was there from
July of 1941 until 20 September 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And the entire staff was there from 20 September
1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Yes. It may be that part of the staff arrived
somewhat later, but the majority of the staff arrived on 20 September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you speaking of the staff of the army
group or the staff of the signal regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I am speaking of both staffs, because the
moving of large staffs such as that of an army group could not
be undertaken in 1 day; usually 2 to 3 days were needed for
that. The operations of the signal corps had to be assured, and
therefore the regiment had to leave some of the staff behind until
the entire staff had been moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where was the advance unit accommodated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: At least part of the advance unit was accommodated
in the Dnieper Castle. Some of the others were in the
neighborhood of those places where later on the companies were
billeted. The reason for that was to keep the billets ready for
this regiment until the bulk of it had been moved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How about the Regimental Staff 537?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: That was in the Dnieper Castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us the names of the officers who
belonged to the regimental staff?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: At that time there was Lieutenant Colonel
Bedenck, the commanding officer; Lieutenant Rex, adjutant; Lieutenant
Hodt, orderly officer; and a Captain Schäfer, who was a
<span class='pageno' title='300' id='Page_300'></span>
telephone expert. It may be that one or two others were there as
well, but I can no longer remember their names.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The preceding witness has already told us
about the tasks of the regimental staff. How were the activities of
the regimental staff controlled?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The regiment, which consisted of 10 to 12
companies, had to give an exact report each evening as to what
work had been allotted to the various companies. This was necessary
as we had to know what forces were available in case of
emergency, for undertaking any new tasks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How far away from the Dnieper Castle were
you billeted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Approximately 4 to 5 kilometers. I cannot
give you the exact distance as I always made it by car, but it would
be about 4 to 5 kilometers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you frequently go to Dnieper Castle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Very frequently when I was off duty, as I
had belonged to this regiment and knew most of the officers, with
whom I was on friendly terms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell us about the kind and extent of
the traffic to the Dnieper Castle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: In order to judge this you have to differentiate
between persons and things. So far as people were concerned,
the traffic was very lively because the regiment had to
be very centrally organized in order to be equal to its tasks. Therefore,
many couriers came and commanders of the various companies
frequently came to visit the regimental staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand there was a heavy traffic of trucks and
passenger cars, because the regiment tried to improve its billets
there; and since we remained there for some time all sorts of
building alterations were carried out in the house.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear anything about there being three
Russian camps with captured Polish officers, 25 to 45 kilometers
west of Smolensk, which had allegedly fallen into German hands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I never heard anything about any kind of
Polish officers’ camps or Polish prisoner-of-war camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did your army group receive reports about the
capture of such Polish officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: No. I would have noticed that, since the
number of prisoners, and especially the number of officers, was
always submitted to me in the evening reports of the armies which
<span class='pageno' title='301' id='Page_301'></span>
took these prisoners. It was our responsibility to receive these
signal reports and we therefore saw them every evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: You did not receive a report to that effect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I neither saw such a report from an army,
which would have issued it, nor did I ever receive a report from
an army group which would have had to transmit this report in
their evening bulletin to the High Command of the Army (OKH).</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Could a report like that have been handed in
from another source or been sent to another office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The official channel in the Army was very
stringent, and the staffs saw to it that official channels were strictly
adhered to. In any case the armies were always required to make
the detailed reports, following the lines stipulated in the form
sheets and this applied especially to the figures concerning prisoners.
Therefore, it is quite out of the question that if such a
number of officers had fallen into the hands of an army, it would
not have reported the matter through the appropriate channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: You said, just a little while ago, that you were
in particularly close relationship with the officers of this regiment.
Did you ever hear that Polish prisoners of war, officers, were shot
at some time or other in the Katyn forest at the instigation of
Regiment 537 under Colonel Bedenck or under Colonel Ahrens?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I knew nearly all the officers of the regiment,
as I myself had been over a year with the regiment, and I was
on such familiar terms with most of the officers that they told me
everything that took place, even anything of an unofficial nature.
Therefore, it is quite out of the question that such an important
matter should not have come to my knowledge. From the nature
of the whole character moulding in the regiment, it is quite impossible
that there should not have been at least one who would have
come to tell me about it immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were all the operational orders for Regiment 537
officially known to you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The operational orders for this army group
signal regiment were twofold: The orders which concerned only
the wireless company and those which applied to the nine telephone
companies. Since I was a telephone expert, it was quite natural
for me to draft these orders and submit them to my superior,
General Oberhäuser. Therefore, each order which was issued had
either been drafted by me or I had seen it beforehand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was there ever at any time an order given
out by your office to shoot Polish prisoners of war?
<span class='pageno' title='302' id='Page_302'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Such an order was neither given to the regiment
by our office nor by any other office. Neither did we receive
a report to this effect, nor did we hear about things like that
through any other channel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: If an order like that came through official
channels, it could come only through you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: This order would have necessitated a great
many members of the regiment being taken away from their own
duties, which were to safeguard the system of communications. As
we were very short of signallers, we had to know what almost
every man in the regiment was doing. It would have been quite
out of the question for any member of the regiment to have been
taken away from such a duty without our knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kranzbühler, whom are you appearing
on behalf of?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: For Grossadmiral Dönitz,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: There is no charge made against Grossadmiral
Dönitz in connection with this offense at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Mr. President, the exhumations
and the propaganda connected with them occurred
during the period when Grossadmiral Dönitz was Commander-in-Chief
of the Navy. The Prosecution alleges that at that time Grossadmiral
Dönitz was a member of the Cabinet and had participated
in all acts taken by the Government. Therefore, I must consider
him as being implicated in all the problems arising out of the
Katyn case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That would mean that we should have to
hear examination from everybody who was connected with the
Government. And the Tribunal has already pointed out, with reference
to Admiral Raeder, that his case was not connected with this
matter. It is only when a case is directly connected with the matter
that counsel for the individual defendants are allowed to cross-examine,
in addition to the defendant’s counsel who calls the witness.
If there is any suggestion that you want to make to the
counsel who is calling the witness, you can make it to him, but you
are not entitled...</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: But I am asking your
permission to put two or three questions to this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you have any special questions to put,
you may suggest them to Dr. Stahmer, and Dr. Stahmer will put
<span class='pageno' title='303' id='Page_303'></span>
them. Dr. Kranzbühler, if you want to put any questions, you
may put them to Dr. Stahmer, and he will put them to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Mr. President, I did not
quite understand. Shall I propose to Dr. Stahmer to put the
questions or...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you cannot do it verbally, you may do it
in writing, and you may do it later on. But I really do not think
there can be any questions which are so difficult to suggest to
Dr. Stahmer as all that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: They can also be put
through Dr. Stahmer. I was only thinking that I would save some
time by putting the questions myself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I told you if you wish to ask any questions,
you must ask them through Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: In the meantime, the Tribunal will go on
with the cross-examination, and any questions which you wish to
put can be put in re-examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Does the Prosecution wish to cross-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, I am interested to
know your exact function in the army. Were you in charge of
teleprinter communications at the headquarters of Army Group
Center or were you a wireless expert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: No, Mr. Prosecutor, you are wrong. I was
the telephone expert of Army Group Center, not the wireless
expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is exactly what I am
asking you. The translation was evidently incorrect. So you were
in charge of telephone communications, were you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Yes; you are right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Ordinary telegrams, or ciphered
telegrams?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The task of a telephone expert connected
with an army group consisted in keeping the telephone lines
intact...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am not interested in the
tasks in a general way. I would like to know whether these were
secret ciphered telegrams or the ordinary army mail, army communications
which were not secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: There were two kinds of telegrams, open
and secret.
<span class='pageno' title='304' id='Page_304'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were secret telegrams transmitted
by you, too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Both came through me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, all communications
between the Wehrmacht, between Army units and the highest
police authorities also passed through you; is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: The most important telegrams, and especially
the secret ones were submitted to the telephone expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes. Consequently, the correspondence
between the police authorities and the Armed Forces
units passed through you; is that correct? I am asking you this
question for a second time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I must answer with the reservation that the
messages did not pass through the telephone expert, but only the
most important secret teletype matters were submitted to him—not
the whole correspondence, because that went also through the
mail as well as by courier service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is clear. Do you know in
this case that in September and October 1941 there were special
detachments in Smolensk whose duty, in close co-operation with the
Army, was to carry out the so-called purge of the prisoner-of-war
camps and the extermination of prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. LATERNSER: Mr. President, I must decisively object to this
questioning of the witness. This questioning can have only the
purpose of determining the relations between the General Staff
and the OKW and any commands of the Security Service. Therefore,
they are accusing the General Staff and the OKW; and if I,
Mr. President, as defense counsel for the General Staff and the
OKW am not permitted to put questions, then on the basis of
equal treatment, the same rules must apply to the Prosecution
as well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I, Mr. President, make a
short statement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, the question is competent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I beg your pardon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I said the question was competent. You may
ask the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like to ask you the
following question, Witness. Since all secret teletypes passed
through you, did you ever encounter among these telegrams any
from the so-called 1st Einsatzgruppe “B”—that was the so-called
first command—or from the Special Command “Moscow” which at
<span class='pageno' title='305' id='Page_305'></span>
that time was located at Smolensk and kept in reserve in anticipation
of better times? The latter had the order to perpetrate mass murders
in Moscow. Both commands were located at Smolensk at
that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: No such reports came into my hands. I can
fully explain this to you, Mr. Prosecutor. When any detachments
of this sort had been established in the area of Army Group Center,
these detachments had their own wireless stations. It was only
later on in the course of the Russian campaign that these posts had
teletype facilities as well; then they used the army group network.
However, that only happened later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, the telegrams of
those special units which, by order of high police authorities, were
assigned to carry out special actions in co-operation with military
units, did not pass through your hands in September and October
of 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: That is correct. At that time, there were no
teletype facilities and offices for such special units, even if they
were in that area at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, this document
was already presented to the Court together with the Extraordinary
State Commission Report, Document Number USSR-3. If the High
Tribunal will permit it, I should like to present to the Tribunal
and to the Defense photostatic copies of one of the documents
which was attached to the report of the Extraordinary State Commission.
If the Tribunal will look at Page 2 of this document, it
will see that the Special Command “Moscow” and the Einsatzgruppe
“B” were both located in Smolensk. It says on the first
page that these detachments together with units of the Armed
Forces, were assigned to carry out mass killings in the camps. If
the Tribunal will permit me, I shall submit this document now...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, that is a matter of argument.
We shall take judicial notice of it, of course, of everything
which is in the Soviet Government’s publication. And I understand
you to say that this document is a part of the Soviet Government
communication or Soviet Government report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President; but I would
like to ask permission to present an original German document, a
secret document, which states that in the Smolensk area there were
two large special commands whose duties were to carry out mass
murders in the camps, and that these actions had to be carried out
together with the Armed Forces units which had to co-operate with
them.
<span class='pageno' title='306' id='Page_306'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, is this document which you
have just handed up to us a part of the report USSR-3?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President, it is a part
of the report, Document USSR-3, called “Special Directives of the
Hitler Government Concerning the Annihilation of Prisoners of
War.” I would like to ask the Tribunal to allow me to present one
of the original documents even if the report, USSR-3, has been
already submitted in full.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It says there that these special units were located in Smolensk
and were assigned together with the Armed Forces units to carry
out mass killings in the camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Colonel Smirnov. This document is
already in evidence, if the Tribunal understands correctly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Consequently, we may consider it as an
established fact that the correspondence, the telegraphic messages of
these special detachments did not pass through your hands; is that
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He has said that twice already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Why did you assert with such certainty
that there were no reports about the killing of the Poles? You know
that the killing of the Polish prisoners of war was a special action,
and any report about this action would have to pass through your
hands? Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I answered the prosecutor—rather, I answered
Dr. Stahmer—that if in the area of Army Group Signal
Regiment 537 killings of that sort had taken place, I would undoubtedly
have known about them. I did not state what the prosecutor
is now trying to ascribe to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, the Tribunal think you had
better read this passage from this document, which is in the German
language, to the Tribunal so that it will go into the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In this document, Mr. President,
it is stated...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Colonel Smirnov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This document is dated “Berlin, 29 October 1941.” It is headed,
“The Chief of the Security Police and of the Security Service.” It
has a classification, “Top Secret; Urgent letter; Operational Order
Number-14.” Reference is made to decrees of 17 July and 12 September
1941. I shall now read a few short sentences, and I shall
begin with the first sentence:
<span class='pageno' title='307' id='Page_307'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the appendix, I am sending directions for the evacuation
of Soviet civilian prisoners and prisoners of war out of
permanent prisoner-of-war camps and transit camps in
the rear of the Army...</p>

<p>“These directives have been worked out in collaboration with
the Army High Command. The Army High. Command has
notified the commanders of the armies in the rear as well as
the local commanders of the prisoner-of-war camps and of
the transit camps.</p>

<p>“The task force groups, depending on the size of the camp in
their territory, are setting up special commands in sufficient
strength under the leadership of an SS leader. The commands
are instructed immediately to start work in the camps.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I break off here, and will continue reading the last paragraph:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I emphasize especially that Operational Orders Number 8
and 14 as well as the appendix are to be destroyed immediately
in the case of immediate danger.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall finish my reading and now I shall only mention the distribution
list. On Page 2 I quote the part concerning Smolensk. It
says here that in Smolensk the Einsatzgruppe “B” was located, consisting
of Special Commands 7a, 7b, 8, and 9; and in addition to this,
there was already located in Smolensk a special command, which
had been rather prematurely named “Moscow” by its organizers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These are the contents of the document, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal directs that the whole document
shall be translated. We will now recess until 5 minutes past
2 o’clock.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1405 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='308' id='Page_308'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no more
questions to put to this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, do you know who owned that little
castle near the Dnieper before the occupation by German troops?
Who owned it, who lived there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: I cannot say that for certain. We noticed that
the little castle was astonishingly well furnished. It was very well
laid out. It had two bathrooms, a rifle range, and a cinema. We
drew certain conclusions therefrom, when the facts became known,
but I do not know anything about the previous owner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The Russian Prosecutor submitted to you a document
dated 29 October 1941, “Directives to the Chief of the Sipo for
the Detachments in the Stalags.” With reference to that document,
I want to ask you whether you had an opportunity personally to
ascertain the attitude of Field Marshal Kluge, your commander of
Army Group Center, regarding the shooting of prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: By chance I became the ear-witness of a conversation
between the Commanders Bock and Kluge. That conversation
took place about 3 or 4 weeks before the beginning of
the Russian campaign. I cannot tell you the exact time. At the
time Field Marshal Von Bock was the commander of Army Group
Center, and Field Marshal Von Kluge was commander of the 4th
Army. The army group was in Posen and the 4th Army at Warsaw.
One day I was called by the aide-de-camp of Field Marshal
Von Beck, who was Lieutenant Colonel Count Hardenberg. He
gave me the order...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: These details are entirely irrelevant, aren’t
they. All you want to ask him is: What was the attitude of Von
Kluge? That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The answer did not come through. I did not
understand what you said, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What I said was that all these details about
the particular place where Von Kluge met some other army group
commander are utterly irrelevant. All you are trying to ask him is:
What was Von Kluge’s attitude toward the murder of war prisoners?
Isn’t that all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Will you answer the question briefly,
Witness. Please just tell us what Von Kluge said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: Von Kluge told Von Bock, during a telephone
conversation, that the order for the shooting of certain prisoners of
<span class='pageno' title='309' id='Page_309'></span>
war was an impossibility and could not be carried out, with regard
to the discipline of the troops. Von Bock shared this point of view
and both these gentlemen talked for half an hour about the measures
which they wanted to adopt against this order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: According to the allegations of the Prosecution,
the shooting of these 11,000 Polish officers is supposed to have been
carried out sometime in September 1941. The question now is: Do
you consider it possible, in view of local conditions, that such mass
shootings and burials could have been carried out next door to the
regimental headquarters without you yourself having heard about it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON EICHBORN: We were very busy in preparation for the
move of the army group to Smolensk. We had assigned a great
number of signal troops for setting up perfect installations. On the
entire site there was a constant going and coming of troops laying
cables and telephone lines. It is out of the question that anything
of this kind could have occurred in that particular area without the
regiment and I getting knowledge of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions to put to the
witness, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, before calling my third witness,
Lieutenant General Oberhäuser, may I ask your permission to make
the following remarks?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has up to now only alleged that Regiment Number
537 was the one which had carried out these shootings and that
under Colonel Ahrens’ command. Today again, Colonel Ahrens has
been named by the Prosecution as being the perpetrator. Apparently
this allegation has been dropped and it has been said that if it
was not Ahrens then it must have been his predecessor, Colonel
Bedenck; and if Colonel Bedenck did not do it, then apparently—and
this seems to be the third version—it was done by the SD. The
Defense had taken the position solely that Colonel Ahrens was
accused as the perpetrator and it has refuted that allegation. Considering
the changed situation and the attitude adopted by the
Prosecution, I shall have to name a fourth witness in addition. That
is First Lieutenant Hodt, who has been mentioned today as the perpetrator
and who was with the regimental staff right from the
beginning and who was, as we have told, the senior of the advance
party which arrived at the Dnieper Castle in July. I got the address
of First Lieutenant Hodt by chance yesterday. He is at Glücksburg
near Flensburg; and I, therefore, ask to be allowed to name as a
witness First Lieutenant Hodt, who will give evidence that during
the time between July and September such shootings did not occur.
<span class='pageno' title='310' id='Page_310'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal will consider your
application, when they adjourn at half past 3, with reference to this
extra witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Sir. Then I shall now call Lieutenant
General Oberhäuser as witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Oberhäuser took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>EUGEN OBERHÄUSER (Witness): Eugen Oberhäuser.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: General, what position did you hold during
the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I was the signal commander in an army group,
first of all during the Polish campaign, in Army Group North; then,
in the Western campaign Army Group B; and then in Russia, Army
Group Center.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When did you and your staff reach the neighborhood
of Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Sometime during September 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where was your staff located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: My staff was located in the immediate vicinity
of the commander of the army group; that is to say, about 12 kilometers
west of Smolensk, near the railroad station of Krasnibor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was Regiment Number 537 under your command?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Regiment 537 was directly under my command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What task did that regiment have?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: That regiment had the task of establishing both
telegraph and wireless communications between the command of
the army group and the various armies and other units which were
directly under its command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was the staff of the regiment stationed near you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The staff of that regiment was located about 3,
perhaps 4 kilometers west from my own position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us more detailed information
regarding the exact location of the staff headquarters of Number 537?
<span class='pageno' title='311' id='Page_311'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The staff headquarters of 537 was in a very nice
Russian timber house. Commissars were supposed to have been
living there before. It was on the steep bank of the Dnieper River.
It was somewhat off the road, perhaps 400 to 500 meters away. It
was, from my place, 4 kilometers west of the main highway
Smolensk to Vitebsk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Who was the commanding officer of the regiment
after the capture of Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: After the capture of Smolensk, Colonel Bedenck
was the commander of the regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: For how long?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Until about November 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Who was his successor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: His successor was Colonel Ahrens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How long?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Approximately until September—it may have
been August—1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you near Katyn as long as that, too?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I was there until the command of the army
group transferred its headquarters farther west.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What were your relations with the commanders
of this regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: My relations with the regimental commanders
were most hearty, both officially and privately, which is due to the
fact that I had been the first commander of that regiment. I myself
had formed the regiment and I was most attached to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you personally visit the little Dnieper Castle
frequently?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I went to the Dnieper Castle frequently; I can
well say in normal times once or twice a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did the commanders visit you in the meantime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The commanders came to see me more frequently
than I went to see them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you know anything about the fact that near
Smolensk, about 25 to 45 kilometers to the west, there were three
Russian camps which contained Polish prisoners of war...</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I knew nothing of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: ...who had fallen into the hands of the Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I never heard anything about it.
<span class='pageno' title='312' id='Page_312'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was there an order, which is supposed to have
come from Berlin, that Polish officers who were prisoners of war
were to be shot?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: No, such an order was never issued.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you yourself ever give such an order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I have never given such an order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether Colonel Bedenck or Colonel
Ahrens ever caused such shootings to be carried out?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I am not informed, but I consider it absolutely
impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: First, because such a decisive order would necessarily
have gone through me, for I was the direct superior of the
regiment; and second, because if such an order had been given, for
a reason which I could not understand, and transmitted to the regiment
through some obscure channel, then the commanders would
most certainly have rung me up or they would have come to see
me and said, “General, they are asking something here which we
cannot understand.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know First Lieutenant Hodt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes, I know him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What position did he have in Regiment 537?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Hodt held various posts in the regiment. Usually,
he was sent ahead because he was a particularly qualified
officer—especially in regard to technical qualifications—in order to
make preparations when headquarters was being changed. He was
therefore used as advance party of the so-called technical company
in order to establish the new command posts; and then he was the
regimental expert for the telephone system, dealing with all matters
relating to the telephone and teletype system with the command
headquarters of the army group. In my staff he was occasionally
detailed to fill the positions of any of my officers when they were
on leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was he also in charge of the advance party
during the advance on Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: That I cannot say. I can only say that I personally
heard from my staff signal commander that he had sent
an officer ahead, after it had been ascertained how the headquarters
were to be laid out, that this officer was acting on my behalf, as
at the time I still remained in the old quarters, and he was preparing
things in the way I wanted them from the point of view of
the signal commander. I do not know who was in charge of that
<span class='pageno' title='313' id='Page_313'></span>
advance party at the time, but it is quite possible that it was First
Lieutenant Hodt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you in Katyn or the vicinity during the
period after the capture of Smolensk, which was, I believe, on or
about 20 July 1941, and up to the transfer of your staff to Katyn
on 20 September?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I was in the vicinity. I was where the headquarters
of the army group wanted to settle down; that is, in the
woods west of Smolensk, where Katyn is located.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you frequently there during that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I should say three or four times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you talk to Hodt on those occasions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: If he was the officer in charge of the advance
party, which I cannot say today, then I must certainly have talked
to him. At any rate, I did talk to the officer whom I had sent ahead
and also to the one from my regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear anything about shootings occurring
during that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I heard nothing, nor did I hear anything at all
except in 1943, when the graves were opened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you or Regiment 537 have the necessary
technical means, pistols, ammunition, and so on, at your disposal
which would have made it possible to carry out shootings on such
a scale?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The regiment, being a signal regiment in the
rear area, was not equipped with weapons and ammunition as well
as the actual fighting troops. Such a task, however, would have
been something unusual for the regiment; first, because a signal
regiment has completely different tasks, and secondly it would not
have been in a position technically to carry out such mass executions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know the place where these graves were
discovered later on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I know the site because I drove past it a great
deal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you describe it more accurately?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Taking the main road Smolensk-Vitebsk, a path
led through wooded undulating ground. There were sandy spaces,
which were, however, covered with scrub and heather, and along
that narrow path one got to the Dnieper Castle from the main road.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were the places where these graves were later
discovered already overgrown when you got there?
<span class='pageno' title='314' id='Page_314'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: They were overgrown just like the surrounding
ground, and there was no difference between them and the rest of
the surroundings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In view of your knowledge of the place, would
you consider it possible that 11,000 Poles could have been buried
at that spot, people who may have been shot between June and
September 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I consider that it is out of the question, for the
mere reason that if the commander had known it at the time he
would certainly never have chosen this spot for his headquarters,
next to 11,000 dead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you tell me how the graves were discovered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Officially I had nothing to do with that. I only
heard that through local inhabitants or somebody else it had become
known that large-scale executions had taken place there years ago.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: From whom did you hear that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Quite probably from the commander himself,
who, because he was located on the spot, had heard more about it
than I had. But I cannot remember exactly now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: So you did not receive official notice about the
discovery of the graves, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: No, I never did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: After the opening of the graves, did you talk
to the German or foreign members of the commission?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I have never talked to any members of that
commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, you arrived in the
region of Katyn in September 1943?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: 1941, not 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, I meant September
1941. Is that correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes, September 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you contend that you did
not know anything either about the camps for Polish prisoners of
war or the prisoners in the hands of the German troops, is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I have never heard anything about Polish prisoners
of war being in the hands of German troops.
<span class='pageno' title='315' id='Page_315'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I understand that this had no
relation to your official activity as the commander of a signal regiment.
But in spite of this you may perhaps have witnessed that
various German troops combed the woods in the vicinity of the
Smolensk-Vitebsk highway to capture Polish prisoners of war who
had escaped from the camps?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I never heard anything about troops going there
in order to, shall we say, recapture escaped Polish prisoners of war.
I am hearing this here for the first time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer me. Have you
perhaps seen German military units escorting Polish prisoners of
war who were captured in the woods?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I have not seen that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the following
question: You were on good terms with Colonel Ahrens, were
you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I have had good relations with all commanders
of the regiment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And in addition to that, you
were his immediate superior?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Colonel Ahrens found out about
the mass graves at the end of 1941 or at the beginning of 1942. Did
he tell you anything about his discovery?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot believe that Colonel Ahrens could have
discovered the graves in 1941. I cannot imagine that—I especially
cannot imagine that he would tell me nothing about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: In any case do you contend that
neither in 1942 nor in 1943 did Colonel Ahrens report to you in
regard to this affair?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Colonel Ahrens never told me anything about
it, and he would have told me if he had known.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am interested in the following
answer which you gave to a question by defense counsel. You
remarked that the signal regiment had not enough weapons to carry
out shootings. What do you mean by that? How many, and what
kind of weapons did the regiment possess?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The signal regiment were mostly equipped with
pistols and with carbines. They had no automatic arms.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Pistols? Of what caliber?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: They were Parabellum pistols. The caliber, I
think, was 7.65, but I cannot remember for certain.
<span class='pageno' title='316' id='Page_316'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Parabellum pistols, 7.65, or were
there Mauser pistols or any other kind of weapons?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: That varied. Noncommissioned officers, as far
as I know, had the smaller Mauser pistols. Actually, only noncommissioned
officers were equipped with pistols. The majority of
the men had carbines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to tell us some
more about the pistols. You say that they were 7.65 caliber pistols,
is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot now, at the moment, give you exact
information about the caliber. I only know that the Parabellum
pistol was 7.65 or some such caliber. I think the Mauser pistol had
a somewhat smaller caliber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And Walter pistols?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: There were also Walters. I think they had the
same caliber as the Mauser. It is a smaller, black pistol; and it is
better than the somewhat cumbersome Parabellum pistol which is
heavier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is quite correct. Please
tell me whether in this regiment the noncommissioned officers possessed
those small pistols.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: As a rule, noncommissioned officers had pistols
but not carbines.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I see. Perhaps you can tell us
about how many pistols this signal regiment possessed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Of course I cannot tell you that now. Let us
assume that every noncommissioned officer had a pistol...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And how many noncommissioned
officers were there? How many pistols in all were there in your
regiment if you consider that every noncommissioned officer had a
pistol?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Assuming that every noncommissioned officer in
the regiment had a pistol that would amount to 15 per company,
a total of 150. However, to give a definite statement about that
figure retrospectively now is impossible. I can only give you clues.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why do you consider that
150 pistols would be insufficient to carry out these mass killings
which went on over a period of time? What makes you so positive
about that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Because a signal regiment of an army group
deployed over a large area as in the case of Army Group Center is
never together as a unit. The regiment was spread out from Kolodov
<span class='pageno' title='317' id='Page_317'></span>
as far as Vitebsk, and there were small detachments everywhere,
and in the headquarters of the regiment there were comparatively
few people; in other words, there were never 150 pistols in one and
the same place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The main part of the signal regiment
was located in the Katyn woods, was it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I did not understand your question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: The main portions of your regiment
were located in the Katyn woods, were they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The first company was mainly located between
the regimental staff quarters and the actual command post of the
army group. That was the company which was handling the communications,
the telephone and teleprinted communications for the
army group. It was the company, therefore, which was nearest.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One more question. The officers
of your regiment were obviously armed with pistols and not with
carbines?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Officers had pistols only, and as a rule they only
had small ones. Possibly one or the other may have had a Parabellum
pistol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say either a Walter
or a Mauser?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you frequently visit the villa
where the headquarters of Regiment 537 was located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes, I was there at least once, sometimes twice,
a week.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you ever interested as to
why soldiers from other military units visited the villa in Kozy
Gory and why special beds were prepared for them as well as
drinks and food?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot imagine that there were any large-scale
visits of other soldiers or members of other units. I do not
know anything about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am not speaking about a great
number. I am speaking of 20 or sometimes 25 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: If the regimental commander summoned his
company and detachment commanders for an officers’ meeting, then,
of course, there would be a few dozen of such officers who normally
would not be seen there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I am not talking about officers
who belonged to the unit. I would like to ask you another
<span class='pageno' title='318' id='Page_318'></span>
somewhat different question. Would the number 537 appear on the
shoulder straps of the soldiers belonging to that regiment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: As far as I recollect the number was on the
shoulder straps, but at the beginning of the war it could be concealed
by a camouflage flap. I cannot remember whether during
that particular period these covers were used or not. At any rate
at the street entrance to the regimental headquarters there was a
black-yellow-black flag, which bore the number 537.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I am speaking of soldiers who
came to the villa in Kozy Gory, and who did not have the number
537 on their shoulder straps. Were you ever interested in finding
out what those soldiers did there in September and October of 1941?
Did the commander of the unit report to you about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: May I ask what year this was supposed to be,
1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, 1941, that is the year which
is concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I do not think that at that time there was much
coming and going of outsiders at staff headquarters because during
that period everything was in course of construction and I cannot
imagine that other units, even small groups of 20 or 25 people
should have been there. I personally, as I have told you, was there
only once or twice weekly, and not before September or October.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Beginning with what date of
September did you start visiting there? You said it was in September
but not from what date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot tell you. The commander of the army
group moved at the end of September from Borossilov, shortly
before the battle of Vyazma, which was on 2 October, into that
district.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, you could start
visiting this villa for instance only at the end of September or the
beginning of October 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: It was only then that the little castle was finally
occupied, for the regiment did not arrive much earlier than we from
the command of the army group.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, is it necessary to go into
this detail? Have you any particular purpose in going into so much
detail?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I ask this question
for the following reasons: Later we shall interrogate witnesses
for the Soviet Prosecution on the same point and particularly the
<span class='pageno' title='319' id='Page_319'></span>
chief of the medico-legal investigation. That is why I would like
to ask the permission of the Court to clarify this point concerning
the time when the witness visited the villa. That will be my last
question to this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, very well. Do not go into greater detail
than you find absolutely necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, at the beginning
of September and the first part of October 1941 you were not in the
villa of Katyn woods and you could not be there at the time, is
that true?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot remember that exactly. The regimental
commander had spotted the little castle and set it up for his staff
headquarters. When exactly he moved in I cannot know, because
I had other jobs to do.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, I asked whether you personally
could not have been in the villa during the first part of
September. Could you not possibly have been there before 20 September?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I do not think so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to re-examine, Dr. Stahmer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Unfortunately, Mr. President, I shall have to
come back to the question of time because it was not brought out
too clearly during these last questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When did Regiment 537 move into the castle?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I assume it was during September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Beginning or end of September?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Probably rather more toward the end of September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Until then only the advance party was there,
or...</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: The advance party of the regiment was there
and my officers whom I had sent ahead.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many noncommissioned officers were with
the advance party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot tell you exactly how many the regiment
sent. I personally had sent one officer. Generally the regiment
could not have sent very many. As a rule, as is always the
case, the regiment was still operating at the old command post in
<span class='pageno' title='320' id='Page_320'></span>
Borossilov and simultaneously it had to set up the new post. Consequently,
during this period of regrouping, on the point of moving
a command of an army group, there is always a considerable shortage
of men. The old headquarters still has to be looked after, the new
post requires men for its construction, so that as always during
this period there were certainly too few people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you not even give us an estimate of the
figure of that advance party?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: There were 30, 40, or 50 men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many noncommissioned officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Probably one or two officers, a few noncommissioned
officers, and some men.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The regiment was very widely spread out, was
it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How far, approximately?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: In the entire area of Army Group Center, shall
we say between Orel and Vitebsk—in that entire area they were
widely dispersed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many kilometers was that, approximately?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: More than 500 kilometers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know Judge Advocate General Dr. Konrad
of Army Group Center?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether, in 1943, he interrogated
the local inhabitants under oath about the date when the Polish
officers were supposed to have been shot in the woods of Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: No, I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Were there any Einsatzkommandos in the
Katyn area during the time that you were there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Nothing has ever come to my knowledge
about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you ever hear of an order to shoot Soviet
commissars?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I only knew of that by hearsay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Probably at the beginning of the Russian campaign,
I think.
<span class='pageno' title='321' id='Page_321'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Before the campaign started or after?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: I cannot remember having heard anything like
that before the beginning of the campaign.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Who was to carry out that order?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Strictly speaking, signal troops are not really
fighting troops. Therefore, they really had nothing to do with that
at all, and therefore we were in no way affected by the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I did not ask you that. I asked you who had
to carry out the order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: Those who came into contact with these people,
presumably.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Anybody who came in contact with Russian
commissars had to kill them; is that it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>OBERHÄUSER: No, I assume that it was the troops, the fighting
troops, the actual fighting troops at the front who first met the
enemy. That could only have applied to the army group. The signal
regiment never came into a position to meet commissars. That is
probably why they were not mentioned in the order or affected by
it in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I ask permission
to call as witness the former deputy mayor of the city of Smolensk
during the German occupation, Professor of Astronomy, Boris Bazilevsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, let him come in then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Bazilevsky took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you state your full name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BORIS BAZILEVSKY (Witness): Boris Bazilevsky.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you make this form of oath: I, a citizen
of the USSR—called as a witness in this case—solemnly promise
and swear before the High Tribunal—to say all that I know about
this case—and to add or to withhold nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: With the permission of the Tribunal,
I should like to start with my interrogation, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell us, Witness, what
your activity was before the German occupation of the city and
district of Smolensk and where you were living in Smolensk.
<span class='pageno' title='322' id='Page_322'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Before the occupation of Smolensk and the surrounding
region...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: ...I lived in the city of Smolensk and was professor
first at the Smolensk University and then of the Smolensk
Pedagogical Institute, and at the same time I was director of the
Smolensk Astronomical Observatory. For 10 years I was the dean
of the physics and mathematics faculty, and in the last years I was
deputy to the director of the scientific department of the Institute.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many years did you live in
Smolensk previous to the German occupation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: From 1919.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know what the so-called
Katyn wood was?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Actually, it was a grove. It was the favorite
resort of the inhabitants of Smolensk who spent their holidays and
vacations there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was this wood before the war
a special reservation which was fenced or guarded by armed patrols,
by watch dogs?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: During the many years that I lived in Smolensk,
this place was never fenced; and no restrictions were ever placed
on access to it. I personally used to go there very frequently. The
last time I was there was in 1940 and in the spring of 1941. In this
wood there was also a camp for engineers. Thus, there was free
access to this place for everybody.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me in what year there
was an engineer camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: As far as I know, it was there for many years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please speak slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Professor, will you wait a
minute, please? When you see that yellow light go on, it means
that you are going too fast; and when you are asked a question, will
you pause before you answer it? Do you understand?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please repeat your
answer, and very slowly, if you please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: The last time I know that the engineer camp
was in the area of the Katyn wood was in 1941.
<span class='pageno' title='323' id='Page_323'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently, if I understand
you correctly, in 1940 and 1941 before the beginning of the war at
any rate—and you speak of the spring of 1941—the Katyn wood
was not a special reservation and was accessible to everybody?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes. I say that that was the situation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you say this as an eyewitness
or from hearsay?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, I say it as an eyewitness who used to go
there frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell the Tribunal under
what circumstances you became the first deputy mayor of Smolensk
during the period of the German occupation. Please speak slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I was an administration official; and I did not
have an opportunity of leaving the place in time, because I was
busy in saving the particularly precious library of the Institute and
the very valuable equipment. In the circumstances I could not try
to escape before the evening of the 15th, but then I did not succeed
in catching the train. I therefore decided to leave the city on 16 July
in the morning, but during the night of 15 to 16 the city was unexpectedly
occupied by German troops. All the bridges across the
Dnieper were blown up, and I found myself in captivity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After some time, on 20 July, a group of German soldiers came
to the observatory of which I was the director. They took down
that I was the director and that I was living there and that there
was also a professor of physics, Efimov, living in the same building.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the evening of 20 July two German officers came to me and
brought me to the headquarters of the unit which had occupied
Smolensk. After checking my <span class='it'>personalia</span> and after a short conversation,
they suggested that I become mayor of the city. I refused,
basing my refusal on the fact that I was a professor of astronomy
and that, as I had no experience in such matters, I could not undertake
this post. They then declared categorically and with threats,
“We are going to force the Russian intelligentsia to work.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thus, if I understand you correctly,
the Germans forced you by threats to become the deputy
mayor of Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: That is not all. They told me also that in a few
days I would be summoned to the Kommandantur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 25 July a man in civilian clothes appeared at my apartment,
accompanied by a German policeman, and represented himself as a
lawyer, Menschagin. He declared that he came by order of the
military headquarters and that I should accompany him immediately
to headquarters.
<span class='pageno' title='324' id='Page_324'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are spending a lot of time on how he
came to be mayor of Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please allow me to
pass to other questions, Mr. President? Thank you for your observations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Who was your immediate superior?
Who was the mayor of Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What were the relations between
this man and the German administration and particularly with the
German Kommandantur?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: These relations were very good and became
closer and closer every day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Is it correct to say that Menschagin
was the trustee of the German administration and that they
even gave him secret information?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know that in the vicinity
of Smolensk there were Polish prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I do very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Do you know what they were
doing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know what this is going to prove.
You presumably do, but can you not come nearer to the point?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He said that he knew there were
Polish prisoners of war in Smolensk; and, with the permission of
the Tribunal, I would like to ask the witness what these prisoners
of war were doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well; go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer. What were the
Polish prisoners of war doing in the vicinity of Smolensk, and at
what time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: In the spring of 1941 and at the beginning of the
summer they were working on the restoration of the roads, Moscow-Minsk
and Smolensk-Vitebsk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What do you know about the
further fate of the Polish prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Z BAZILEVSKY: Thanks to the position that I occupied, I learned
very early about the fate of the Polish prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell the Tribunal what
you know about it.
<span class='pageno' title='325' id='Page_325'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: In the camp for Russian prisoners of war known
as “Dulag 126” there prevailed such a severe regime that prisoners
of war were dying by the hundreds every day; for this reason I
tried to free all those from this camp for whose release a reason
could be given. I learned that in this camp there was also a very
well-known pedagogue named Zhiglinski. I asked Menschagin to
make representations to the German Kommandantur of Smolensk,
and in particular to Von Schwetz, and to plead for the release of
Zhiglinski from this camp.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please do not go into detail and
do not waste time, but tell the Tribunal about your conversation
with Menschagin. What did he tell you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin answered my request with, “What
is the use? We can save one, but hundreds will die.” However, I
insisted; and Menschagin, after some hesitation, agreed to put this
request to the German Kommandantur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please be short and tell us what
Menschagin told you when he came back from the German Kommandantur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Two days later he told me that he was in a
very difficult situation on account of my demand. Von Schwetz had
refused the request by referring to an instruction from Berlin
saying that a very severe regime should prevail with respect to
prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What did he tell you about
Polish prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: As to Polish prisoners of war, he told me that
Russians would at least be allowed to die in the camps while there
were proposals to exterminate the Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What else was said?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I replied, “What do you mean? What do you
want to say? How do you understand this?” And Menschagin answered,
“You should understand this in the very literal sense of
these words.” He asked me not to tell anybody about it, since it
was a great secret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When did this conversation of
yours take place with Menschagin? In what month, and on
what day?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: This conversation took place at the beginning
of September. I cannot remember the exact date.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But you remember it was the
beginning of September?
<span class='pageno' title='326' id='Page_326'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you ever come back again
to the fate of Polish prisoners of war in your further conversations
with Menschagin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Can you tell us when?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Two weeks later—that is to say, at the end of
September—I could not help asking him, “What was the fate of
the Polish prisoners of war?” At first Menschagin hesitated, and
then he told me haltingly, “They have already died. It is all over
for them.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did he tell you where they were
killed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: He told me that they had been shot in the
vicinity of Smolensk, as Von Schwetz told him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did he mention the exact place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, he did not mention the exact place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me this. Did you, in turn,
tell anybody about the extermination, by Hitlerites, of the Polish
prisoners of war near Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I talked about this to Professor Efimov, who was
living in the same house with me. Besides him, a few days later
I had a conversation about it with Dr. Nikolski, who was the
medical officer of the city. However, I found out that Nikolski
knew about this crime already from some other source.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did Menschagin tell you why
these shootings took place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes. When he told me that the prisoners of
war had been killed, he emphasized once more the necessity of
keeping it strictly secret in order to avoid disagreeable consequences.
He started to explain to me the reasons for the German
behavior with respect to the Polish prisoners of war. He pointed
out that this was only one measure of the general system of treating
Polish prisoners of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did you hear anything about
the extermination of the Poles from the employees of the German
Kommandantur?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, 2 or 3 days later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are both going too fast, and you are
not pausing enough. You are putting your questions whilst the
answers are coming through. You must have longer pauses, and
go slower.
<span class='pageno' title='327' id='Page_327'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Please continue, but slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know where I was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked you whether any of the
employees of the German Kommandantur told you anything about
the extermination of the Poles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Two or three days later, when I visited the office
of Menschagin, I met there an interpreter, the Sonderführer of the
7th Division of the German Kommandantur who was in charge
of the Russian administration and who had a conversation with
Menschagin concerning the Poles. He came from the Baltic region.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Perhaps you can tell us briefly
what he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: When I entered the room he was saying, “The
Poles are a useless people, and exterminated they may serve as
fertilizer and for the enlargement of living space for the German
nation.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are doing exactly what I said just now.
You are asking the questions before the translation comes through.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, Mr. President, I
will try to speak more slowly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Did you learn from Menschagin anything
definite about the shooting of Polish prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: When I entered the room I heard the conversation
with Hirschfeld. I missed the beginning, but from the context
of the conversation it was clear that they spoke about this
event.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did Menschagin, when telling
you about the shooting of Polish prisoners of war, refer to
Von Schwetz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes; I had the impression that he referred to
Von Schwetz. But evidently—and this is my firm belief—he also
spoke about it with private persons in the Kommandantur.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: When did Menschagin tell you
that Polish prisoners of war were killed near Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: It was at the end of September.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions to
put to this witness, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='328' id='Page_328'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: If it please the Tribunal, the Defendant Hess is
absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, in your testimony, just before recess,
you read out your testimony, if I observed correctly. Will you
tell me whether that was so or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I was not reading anything. I have only a plan
of the courtroom in my hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It looked to me as though you were reading
out your answers. How can you explain the fact that the interpreter
already had your answer in his hands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know how the interpreters could have
had my answers beforehand. The testimony which I am giving
was, however, known to the Commission beforehand—that is, my
testimony during the preliminary examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know the little castle on the Dnieper,
the little villa? Did you not understand me or hear me? Do you
know the little castle on the Dnieper, the little villa on the Dnieper?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know which villa you mean. There
were quite a number of villas on the Dnieper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The house which was near the Katyn wood
on the steep bank of the Dnieper River.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I still do not quite understand which house you
mean. The banks of the Dnieper are long, and therefore your
question is quite incomprehensible to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know where the graves of Katyn were
found, in which 11,000 Polish officers were buried?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I was not there. I did not see the Katyn burial
grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Had you never been in the Katyn wood?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: As I already said, I was there not once but
many times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know where this mass burial site was
located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: How can I know where the burial grounds were
situated when I could not go there since the occupation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How do you know that the little wood was not
fenced in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Before the occupation of the Smolensk district
by the German troops, the entire area, as I already stated, was not
surrounded by any barrier; but according to hearsay I knew that
<span class='pageno' title='329' id='Page_329'></span>
after the occupation access to this wood was prohibited by the
German local command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Therefore you have no knowledge of the fact
that here in the Katyn wood a sanitarium or a convalescent home
of the GPU was located?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I know very well; that was known to all the
citizens of Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, of course, you also know exactly which
house I referred to in my question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I, myself, had never been in that house. In
general, access to that house was only allowed to the families of
the employees of the Ministry of the Interior. As to other persons,
there was no need and no facility for them to go there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The house, therefore, was closed off?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, the house was not forbidden to strangers;
but why should people go there if they had no business there or
were not in the sanitarium? The garden, of course, was open to
the public.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were there not guards stationed there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I have never seen any.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Is this Russian witness who reported to you
about the matter concerning the Polish officers, is this witness
still alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Mr. Counsel, you probably mean Mayor Menschagin,
if I understand you rightly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When you read your testimony off, it was not
easy for me to follow. What was the mayor’s name? Menschagin?
Is he still alive?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin went away together with the German
troops during their retreat, and I remained, and Menschagin’s
fate is unknown to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, you are not entitled to say to
the witness, “when you read your testimony off,” just now, because
he denied that he read his testimony off and there is no evidence
that he has read it off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did this Russian witness tell you that the Polish
officers had come from the camp at Kosielsk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean the camp at Kosielsk? Yes?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: The witness did not say that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that place and locality?
<span class='pageno' title='330' id='Page_330'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean Kosielsk? I do, yes. In 1940, in the
month of August—at the end of August—I spent my leave there
with my wife.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether there were Polish
officers at that place in a Russian prisoner-of-war camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I know that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Until what time did these prisoners of war
remain there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I do not know that for sure but at the end of
August 1940 they were there. I am quite sure about that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know whether this camp, together with
its inmates, fell into German hands?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Personally, that is, from my own observation, I
do not know it; but according to rumors, it appears to have been
the case. That is, of course, not my own testimony; I myself did not
see it, but I heard about it only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear what happened to these prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes, I heard, of course, that they remained there
and could not be evacuated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you hear what became of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I have already testified in my answers to the
prosecutor that they were shot on the order of the German
Command.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And where did these shootings take place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Mr. Defense Counsel, you have apparently not
heard my answers. I already testified that Mayor Menschagin said
that they were shot in the neighborhood of Smolensk, but where
he did not tell me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many prisoners were involved?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Do you mean to say, how many were mentioned
in the conversation with Menschagin? I do not understand your
question. Do you mean to say according to the reports of
Menschagin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What was the figure given to you by Menschagin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Menschagin did not tell me any number. I repeat
that this conversation took place on the last days of September 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you give us the name of an eyewitness
who was present at this shooting or anyone who saw this shooting?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I believe that these executions were carried out
under such circumstances that I think it scarcely possible that any
Russian witnesses could be present.
<span class='pageno' title='331' id='Page_331'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, you should answer the question
directly. You were asked, “Can you give the names of anybody who
was there?” You can answer that “yes” or “no” and then you can
add any explanations necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I will follow your instructions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you give the name of anybody who saw
the executions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, I cannot name any eyewitness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What German unit is supposed to have carried
out the shootings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I cannot answer that exactly. It is logical to
assume that it was the construction battalion which was stationed
there; but of course I could not know the exact organization of the
German troops.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did the Poles involved here come from the
camp at Kosielsk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: In general, this was not mentioned in the conversations
of that time, but I certainly do not know that; besides
these might have been any other Polish prisoners of war who had
not been at Kosielsk previously.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you yourself see Polish officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: I did not see them myself, but my students saw
them, and they told me that they had seen them in 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: And where did they see them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: On the road where they were doing repair work
at the beginning of summer, 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In what general area or location?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: In the district of the Moscow-Minsk highway,
somewhat to the west of Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you testify whether the Russian Army
Command had a report to the effect that Polish prisoners at the
camp at Kosielsk had fallen into the hands of the Germans?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, I have no knowledge of that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What is the name of the German official or
employee with whom you talked at the Kommandantur?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Not in the Kommandantur, but in Menschagin’s
office. His name was Hirschfeld.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What was his position?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: He was Sonderführer of the 7th Detachment of
the German Kommandantur in the town of Smolensk.
<span class='pageno' title='332' id='Page_332'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions, Mr. President—just
another question or two, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Were you punished by the Russian
Government on account of your collaboration with the German
authorities?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: No, I was not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Are you at liberty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Not only am I at liberty; but, as I have already
stated, I am still professor at two universities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Therefore, you are back in office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, do you wish to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: No, Mr. President, I have no
further questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, do you know whether the man,
whose name I understand to be Menschagin, was told about these
matters or whether he himself had any direct knowledge of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>BAZILEVSKY: From Menschagin’s own words, I understood
quite definitely that he had heard those things himself at the Kommandantur,
particularly from Von Schwetz, who was the commander
from the beginning of the occupation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I beg the Tribunal
to allow me to call as witness Marko Antonov Markov, a Bulgarian
citizen, professor at the University of Sofia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The interpreter Valev and the witness Markov took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you the interpreter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>LUDOMIR VALEV (Interpreter): Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give us your full name?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VALEV: Ludomir Valev.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
before God and the Law—that I will interpret truthfully and to the
best of my skill—the evidence to be given by the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The interpreter repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>To the witness.</span>] Will you give us your full
name, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARKO ANTONOV MARKOV (Witness): Dr. Marko Antonov
Markov.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear—as
a witness in this case—that I will speak only the truth—being
<span class='pageno' title='333' id='Page_333'></span>
aware of my responsibility before God and the Law—and that I
will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, before this witness is examined, I
would like to call to the attention of the Tribunal the fact that
Dr. Stahmer asked the preceding witness a question which I understood
went: How did it happen that the interpreters had the questions
and the answers to your questions if you didn’t have them
before you? Now that question implied that Dr. Stahmer had some
information that the interpreters did have the answers to the questions,
and I sent a note up to the interpreters, and I have the answer
from the lieutenant in charge that no one there had any answers
or questions, and I think it should be made clear on the record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I think so, too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I was advised of this fact outside the courtroom.
If it is not a fact, I wish to withdraw my statement. I was
informed outside the courtroom from a trustworthy source. I do
not recall the name of the person who told me, I shall have to
ascertain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Such statements ought not be made by
counsel until they have verified them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I begin the examination
of this witness, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The examination, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, I beg you to tell us
briefly, without taking up the time of the Tribunal with too many
details, under what conditions you were included in the so-called
International Medical Commission set up by the Germans in the
month of April 1943 for the examination of the graves of Polish
officers in the Katyn woods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I beg you, when answering me, to pause between the question
I put to you and your own answer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: This occurred at the end of April 1943. While working
in the Medico-Legal Institute, where I am still working, I was
called to the telephone by Dr. Guerow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness must stop before the interpreter
begins. Otherwise, the voices come over the microphone together.
So the interpreter must wait until the witness has finished his answer
before he repeats it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the witness has said—at least this is what I heard—that
in April 1943 he was called on the telephone.
<span class='pageno' title='334' id='Page_334'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I was called to the telephone by Dr. Guerow, the
secretary of Dr. Filoff who was then Prime Minister of Bulgaria.
I was told that I was to take part, as representative of the Bulgarian
Government, in the work of an international medical commission
which had to examine the corpses of Polish officers discovered in
the Katyn wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not wishing to go, I answered that I had to replace the director
of my Institute who was away in the country. Dr. Guerow told me
that according to an instruction of the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
who had sent the telegram, it was precisely in order to replace him
that I would have to go there. Guerow told me to come to the
Ministry. There I asked him if I could refuse to comply with this
order. He answered that we were in a state of war and that the
Government could send anybody wherever and whenever they
deemed it necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Guerow took me to the first secretary of the Minister of Foreign
Affairs, Schuchmanov. Schuchmanov repeated this order and told
me that we were to examine the corpses of thousands of Polish
officers. I answered that to examine thousands of corpses would
take several months, but Schuchmanov said that the Germans had
already exhumed a great number of these corpses and that I would
have to go, together with other members of the commission, in order
to see what had already been done and in order to sign, as Bulgarian
representative, the report of the proceedings which had
already been drafted. After that, I was taken to the German Legation,
to Counsellor Mormann, who arranged all the technical details
of the trip. This was on Saturday; and on Monday morning, 26 April,
I flew to Berlin. There I was met by an official of the Bulgarian
Legation and I was lodged at the Hotel Adlon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the next question:
Who took part in this so-called International Commission, and when
did they leave for Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: On the next day, 27 April, we stayed in Berlin and
the other members of the commission arrived there too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Who were they?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: They were the following, besides myself: Dr. Birkle,
chief doctor of the Ministry of Justice and first assistant of the Institute
of Forensic Medicine and Criminology at Bucharest; Dr. Miloslavich,
professor of forensic medicine and criminology at Zagreb
University, who was representative for Croatia; Professor Palmieri,
who was professor for forensic medicine and criminology at Naples;
Dr. Orsos, professor of forensic medicine and criminology at Budapest;
Dr. Subik, professor of pathological anatomy at the University
of Bratislava and chief of the State Department for Health for
<span class='pageno' title='335' id='Page_335'></span>
Slovakia; Dr. Hajek, professor for forensic medicine and criminology
at Prague, who represented the so-called Protectorate of
Bohemia and Moravia; Professor Naville, professor of forensic
medicine at the University of Geneva, representative for Switzerland;
Dr. Speleers, professor for ophthalmology at Ghent University,
who represented Belgium; Dr. De Burlett, professor of anatomy at
the University of Groningen, representing Holland; Dr. Tramsen,
vice chancellor of the Institute for forensic medicine at Copenhagen
University, representing Denmark; Dr. Saxen, who was professor
for pathological anatomy at Helsinki University, Finland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the investigations of the commission, a Dr. Costeduat was
missing; he declared that he could attend only as a personal
representative of President Laval. Professor Piga from Madrid also
arrived, an elderly gentleman who did not take any part in the work
of the commission. It was stated later that he was ill as a result
of the long journey.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were all these persons flown to
Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: All these persons arrived at Katyn with the exception
of Professor Piga.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Who besides the members of the
commission left for Katyn with you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: On the 28th we took off from Tempelhof Airdrome,
Berlin, for Katyn. We took off in two airplanes which carried about
15 to 20 persons each.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Maybe you can tell us briefly
who was there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Together with us was Director Dietz, who met us
and accompanied us. He represented the Ministry of Public Health.
There were also press representatives, and two representatives of
the Ministry for Foreign Affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I beg you to stop with these
details and to tell me when the commission arrived in Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The commission arrived in Smolensk on 28 April, in
the evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many work days did the
commission stay in Smolensk? I stress work days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We stayed in Smolensk 2 days only, 29 and 30 April
1943, and on 1 May, in the morning, we left Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many times did the members
of the commission personally visit the mass graves in the
Katyn wood?
<span class='pageno' title='336' id='Page_336'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We were twice in the Katyn wood, that is, in the
forenoon of 29 and 30 April.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I mean, how many hours did you
spend each time at the mass graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I consider not more than 3 or 4 hours each time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the members of the commission
present at least once during the opening of one of the
graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: No new graves were opened in our presence. We
were shown only several graves which had already been opened
before we arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, you were shown already
opened graves, near which the corpses were already laid out,
is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Quite right. Near these opened graves were exhumed
corpses already laid out there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the necessary conditions
for an objective and comprehensive scientific examination of the
corpses given to the members of the commission?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The only part of our activity which could be characterized
as a scientific, medico-legal examination were the autopsies
carried out by certain members of the commission who were
themselves medico-legal experts; but there were only seven or
eight of us who could lay claim to that qualification, and as far
as I recall only eight corpses were opened. Each of us operated
on one corpse, except Professor Hajek, who dissected two corpses.
Our further activity during these 2 days consisted of a hasty
inspection under the guidance of Germans. It was like a tourists’
walk during which we saw the open graves; and we were shown
a peasant’s house, a few kilometers distant from the Katyn wood,
where in showcases papers and objects of various sorts were kept.
We were told that these papers and objects had been found in the
clothes of the corpses which had been exhumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you actually present when
these papers were taken from the corpses or were they shown to
you when they were already under glass in display cabinets?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The documents which we saw in the glass cases had
already been removed from the bodies before we arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were you allowed to investigate
these documents, to examine these documents, for instance, to see
whether the papers were impregnated with any acids which had
developed by the decay of the corpses, or to carry out any other
kind of scientific examination?
<span class='pageno' title='337' id='Page_337'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We did not carry out any scientific examination of
these papers. As I have already told you, these papers were exhibited
in glass cases and we did not even touch them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But I would like you nevertheless
to answer me briefly with “yes” or “no,” a question which I
have already put to you. Were the members of the commission given
facilities for an objective examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: In my opinion these working conditions can in no
way be qualified as adequate for a complete and objective scientific
examination. The only thing which bore the character of the scientific
nature was the autopsy which I carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: But did I rightly understand
you, that from the 11,000 corpses which were discovered only 8
were dissected by members of the commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Quite right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please answer the next question.
In what condition were these corpses? I would like you to
describe the state in which they were and also the state of the
inner organs, the tissues, et cetera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: As to the condition of the corpses in the Katyn
graves, I can only judge according to the state of the corpse which
I myself dissected. The condition of this corpse was, as far as I
could ascertain, the same as that of all the other corpses. The skin
was still well preserved, was in part leathery, of a brown-red color
and on some parts there were blue markings from the clothes. The
nails and hair, mostly, had already fallen out. In the head of the
corpse I dissected there was a small hole, a bullet wound in the
back of the head. Only pulpy substance remained of the brain. The
muscles were still so well preserved that one could even see the
fibers of the sinews of heart muscles and valves. The inner organs
were also mainly in a good state of preservation. But of course
they were dried up, displaced, and of a dark color. The stomach
showed traces of some sort of contents. A part of the fat had turned
into wax. We were impressed by the fact that even when pulled
with brute force, no limbs had detached themselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I dictated a report, on the spot, on the result of my investigation.
A similar report was dictated by the other members of the commission
who examined corpses. This report was published by the
Germans, under Number 827, in the book which they published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like you to answer the
following question. Did the medico-legal investigations testify to
the fact that the corpses had been in the graves already for 3 years?
<span class='pageno' title='338' id='Page_338'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: As to that question I could judge only from the
corpse on which I myself had held a post mortem. The condition of
this corpse, as I have already stated, was typical of the average
condition of the Katyn corpses. These corpses were far removed
from the stage of disintegration of the soft parts, since the fat was
only beginning to turn into wax. In my opinion these corpses were
buried for a shorter period of time than 3 years. I considered that
the corpse which I dissected had been buried for not more than
1 year or 18 months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, applying the criteria
of the facts which you ascertained to your experiences in Bulgaria—that
is, in a country of a more southern climate than Smolensk and
where decay, therefore, is more rapid—one must come to the conclusion
that the corpses that were exhumed in the Katyn forest had
been lying under the earth for not more than a year and a half?
Did I understand you correctly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, quite right. I had the impression that they had
been buried for not more than a year and a half.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 2 July 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Markov resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, when did you, together
with the other members of the commission, perform the autopsies
of these eight corpses? What date was it exactly?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: That was on 30 April, early in the day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And, on the basis of your personal
observations, you decided that the corpses were in the ground
1 year or 18 months at the most?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: That is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Before putting the next question
to you, I should like you to give me a brief answer to the following
question: Is it correct that in the practice of Bulgarian medical
jurisprudence the protocol about the autopsy contains two parts,
a description and the deductions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes. In our practice, as well as in the practice of
other countries, so far as I know, it is done in the following way:
First of all, we give a description and then the deduction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was a deduction contained in the
record you made regarding the autopsy?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: My record of the autopsy contained only a description
without any conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Because from the papers which were given to us
there I understood that they wanted us to say that the corpses had
been in the ground for 3 years. This could be deduced from the
papers which were shown to us in the little peasant hut about which
I have already spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: By the way, were these papers
shown to you before the autopsy or afterward?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, the papers were given us 1 day before the
autopsy.
<span class='pageno' title='340' id='Page_340'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you were...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, you are interrupting the
interpreter all the time. Before the interpreter has finished the
answer, you have put another question. It is very difficult for us to
hear the interpreter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Thank you for your indication,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Inasmuch as the objective deduction regarding the
autopsy I performed was in contradiction with this version, I did
not make any deductions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Consequently you did not make
any deduction because the objective data of the autopsy testified to
the fact that the corpses had been in the ground, not 3 years, but
only 18 months?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, you must remember that it
is a double translation, and unless you pause more than you are
pausing, your voice comes in upon the interpreter’s and we cannot
hear the interpreter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, that is quite correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was there unanimity among the
members of the commission regarding the time the corpses had been
in the graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Most of the members of the delegation who performed
the autopsies in the Katyn wood made their deductions without
answering the essential question regarding the time the corpses had
been buried. Some of them, as for instance, Professor Hajek, spoke
about immaterial things; as for instance, that one of the killed had
had pleurisy. Some of the others, as for instance, Professor Birkle
from Bucharest, cut off some hair from a corpse in order to determine
the age of the corpse. In my opinion that was quite immaterial.
Professor Palmieri, on the basis of the autopsy that he
performed, said that the corpse had been in the ground over a year
but he did not determine exactly how long.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only one who gave a definite statement in regard to the time
the corpses had been buried was Professor Miloslavich from Zagreb,
and he said it was 3 years. However, when the German book regarding
Katyn was published, I read the result of his impartial statement
regarding the corpse on which he had performed the autopsy. I had
the impression that the corpse on which he had performed the
autopsy did not differ in its stage of decomposition from the other
corpses. This led me to think that his statement that the corpses had
<span class='pageno' title='341' id='Page_341'></span>
been in the ground for 3 years did not coincide with the facts of his
description.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would like to ask you to reply
to the following question. Were there many skulls found by the
members of the commission with signs of so-called <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>?
By the way, inasmuch as this term is not known in the usual books
on medical jurisprudence and in general criminalistic terminology,
I should like you to give us an exact explanation of what Professor
Orsos, of Budapest, means by the term <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you repeat that question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were there many skulls with
signs of so-called <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> which were submitted to the members
of the commission? Inasmuch as this term is not known in the
usual books on medical jurisprudence, I should like you to give us
a detailed explanation of what Professor Orsos means by the term
<span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What are you saying the skulls had? You
asked if there were many skulls with something or other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I see this term for the first time,
myself, Mr. President. It is <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>. It seems to be a Latin
term of some sort of corn which is formed on the outer surface of
the cerebral substance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you spell the word in Latin?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The prosecutor submitted a paper to the President.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What you have written here is p-s-e-r-d-o.
Do you mean p-s-e-u-d-o, which means false?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, that is right, pseudo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now then, put your question again, and try
to put it shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[Turning to the witness.] Were there many skulls with signs of
so-called <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> shown to the members of the commission?
Will you please give an exact explanation of this term of Professor
Orsos’.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Professor Orsos spoke to us regarding <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>
at a general conference of the delegates. That took place on 30 April,
in the afternoon, in the building where the field laboratory of
Dr. Butz in Smolensk was located.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Professor Orsos described the term <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> as meaning
some sediment of indissoluble salt, of calcium, and other salts on the
inside of the cranium. Professor Orsos stated that, according to his
<span class='pageno' title='342' id='Page_342'></span>
observations in Hungary, this happened if the corpses have been in
the ground for at least 3 years. When Professor Orsos stated this
at the scientific conference, none of the delegates said anything either
for or against it. I deduced from that that this term <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>
was as unknown to the other delegates as it was to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the same conference Professor Orsos showed us such a
<span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> on one of the skulls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like you to answer the
following question: What number did the corpse have from which
this skull with signs of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> was taken?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The corpse from which the skull was taken and which
was noted in the book bore the Number 526. From this I deduced
that this corpse was exhumed before our arrival at Katyn, inasmuch
as all the other corpses on which we performed autopsies on 30 April
had numbers which ran above 800. It was explained to us that as
soon as a corpse was exhumed it immediately received a consecutive
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Tell me this, please. Did you
notice any <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> on the skulls of the corpses on which you
and your colleagues performed autopsies?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: On the skull of the corpse on which I performed an
autopsy, there was some sort of pulpy substance in place of the
brain, but I never noticed any sign of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>. The other delegates—after
the explanation of Professor Orsos—likewise did not
state that they had found any <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> in the other skulls. Even
Butz and his co-workers, who had examined the corpses before our
arrival, did not mention any sign of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Later on, in a book which was published by the Germans and
which contained the report of Butz, I noticed that Butz referred to
<span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> in order to give more weight to his statement that the
corpses had been in the ground for 3 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say, that of the 11,000
corpses only one skull was submitted to you which had <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: That is quite correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like you to describe to
the Tribunal in detail the state of the clothing which you found on
the corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: In general the clothing was well preserved, but of
course it was damp due to the decomposition of the corpses. When
we pulled off the clothing to undress the corpses, or when we tried
to take off the shoes, the clothing did not tear nor did the shoes fall
apart at the seams. I even had the impression that this clothing
could have been used again, after having been cleaned.
<span class='pageno' title='343' id='Page_343'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There were some papers found in the pockets of the clothing of
the corpse on which I performed the autopsy, and these papers were
also impregnated with the dampness of the corpse. Some of the
Germans who were present when I was performing the autopsy
asked me to describe those papers and their contents; but I refused
to do it, thinking that this was not the duty of a doctor. In fact I
had already noticed the previous day that with the help of the dates
contained in those papers, they were trying to make us think that
the corpses had remained in the ground for 3 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I wanted to base my deductions only on the actual
condition of the corpses. Some of the other delegates who performed
autopsies also found some papers in the clothing of the corpses. The
papers which had been found in the clothing of the corpse on which
I performed the autopsy were put into a cover which bore the same
number as the corpse, Number 827. Later on, in the book which was
published by the Germans, I perceived that some of the delegates
described the contents of the papers which were found on the
corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I should like to ask you to reply
to the following question. On what impartial medico-judicial data
did the commission base the deduction that the corpses had remained
in the earth not less than 3 years?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you put the question again? I did not
understand the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I asked on what impartial
medico-judicial data were the deductions of the protocol of the
International Medical Commission based, which stated that the
corpses had remained in the ground not less than 3 years?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has he said that that was the deduction he
made—not less than 3 years?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): He has not said that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He has not said that at all. He never said
that he made the deduction that the corpses remained in the ground
not less than 3 years.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: He did not make this deduction;
but Professor Markov, together with the other members of the commission,
signed a report of the International Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I know; but that is why I ask you to repeat
your question. The question that was translated to us was: On what
grounds did you make your deduction that the corpses had remained,
in the ground not less than 3 years—which is the opposite of what
he said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now will you put the question again?
<span class='pageno' title='344' id='Page_344'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] I am not asking you about your
personal minutes, Witness, but about the general record of the entire
commission. I am asking you on what impartial medico-judicial
data were the deductions of the entire commission based, that the
corpses had remained in the earth not less than 3 years. On the
record of the deductions your signature figures among those of the
other members of the commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute. Now, then, Colonel Smirnov,
will you put the question again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] I was asking you on what impartial
medico-judicial data were the deductions of the commission based—not
the individual report of Dr. Markov, in which there are no
deductions—but the deductions of the entire commission, that the
corpses had remained not less than 3 years in the ground?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The collective protocol of the commission which was
signed by all the delegates was very scant regarding the real
medico-judicial data. Concerning the condition of the corpses, only
one sentence in the report was stated, namely that the corpses were
in various stages of decomposition, but there was no description of
the real extent of decomposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in my opinion, this deduction was based on the papers
found on the corpses and on testimony of the witnesses, but not on
the actual medico-judicial data. As far as medical jurisprudence is
concerned, they tried to support this deduction by the statement of
Professor Orsos regarding the finding of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> in the skull
of corpse Number 526.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But, according to my conviction, since this skull was the only one
with signs of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>, it was wrong to arrive at a definite conclusion
regarding the stage of decomposition of thousands of corpses
which were contained in the Katyn graves. Besides, the observation
of Professor Orsos regarding <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> was made in Hungary;
that is to say, under quite different soil and climatic conditions, and
withal in individual graves and not in mass graves, as was the
case in Katyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: You spoke about the testimony
of witnesses. Did the members of the commission have the opportunity
personally to interrogate those witnesses, especially the
Russian witnesses?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We did not have the opportunity of having any
contact with the indigenous population. On the contrary, immediately
upon our arrival at the hotel in Smolensk, Butz told us that
we were in a military zone, and that we did not have the right to
<span class='pageno' title='345' id='Page_345'></span>
walk around in the city without being accompanied by a member
of the German Army, or to speak with the inhabitants of the place,
or to make photographs. In reality, during the time we were there,
we did not have any contact with the local inhabitants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the first day of our arrival in the Katyn wood, that is to say,
on 29 April, in the morning, several Russian civilians were brought
under German escort to the graves. Immediately upon our arrival
at Smolensk some of the depositions of the local witnesses were
submitted to us. The depositions were typed. When these witnesses
were brought to the Katyn wood, we were told that these witnesses
were the ones who gave the testimonies which had been submitted
to us. There was no regular interrogation of the witnesses which
could have been recorded, or were recorded. Professor Orsos started
the conversation with the witnesses and told us that he could speak
Russian because he had been a prisoner of war in Russia during the
first World War. He began to speak with a man, an elderly man
whose name, so far as I can remember, was Kiselov. Then he spoke
to a second witness, whose last name so far as I can remember was
Andrejev. All the conversation lasted a few minutes only. As our
Bulgarian language is rather similar to the Russian, I tried also to
speak to some of the witnesses...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Don’t you think that should be left to cross-examination?
Can’t these details be left to cross-examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would ask you, Witness, to interrupt the reply to this question
and to answer the following one: At the time you signed this general
report of the commission, was it quite clear to you that the murders
were perpetrated in Katyn not earlier than the last quarter of 1941,
and that 1940, in any case, was excluded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, this was absolutely clear to me and that is why
I did not make any deductions in the minutes which I made on my
findings in the Katyn wood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Why did you sign then this
general report, which was incorrect in your opinion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: In order to make it quite clear under what conditions
I signed this report, I should like to say a few words on how it was
made up and how it was signed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me, I would like to put
a question to you which defines more accurately this matter. Was
this report actually signed on 30 April 1941 in the town of Smolensk
or was it signed on another date and at another place?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: It was not signed in Smolensk on 30 April but was
signed on 1 May at noon, at the airport which was called Bela.
<span class='pageno' title='346' id='Page_346'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Will you please tell the Tribunal
under what conditions it was signed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The compilation of this record was to be done at the
same conference which I already mentioned and which took place in
the laboratory of Butz in the afternoon of 30 April. Present at this
conference were all the delegates and all the Germans who had
arrived with us from Berlin: Butz and his assistants, General Staff
Physician Holm, the chief physician of the Smolensk sector, and also
other German Army officials who were unknown to me. Butz stated
that the Germans were only present as hosts, but actually the conference
was presided over by General Staff Physician Holm and the
work was performed under the direction of Butz. The secretary of
the conference was the personal lady secretary of Butz who took
down the report. However, I never saw these minutes. Butz and
Orsos came with a prepared draft to this conference, a sort of
protocol; but I never learned who ordered them to draw up such a
protocol. This protocol was read by Butz and then a question was
raised regarding the state and the age of the young pines which were
in the clearings of the Katyn wood. Butz was of the opinion that in
these clearings there were graves too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me for interrupting you.
Did you have any evidence that any graves were actually found in
these clearings?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: No. During the time we were there, no new graves
were opened. As some of the delegates said they were not competent
to express their opinion regarding the age of these trees, General
Holm gave an order to bring a German who was an expert on
forestry. He showed us the cut of the trunk of a small tree and from
the number of circles in this trunk, he deduced the trees were
5 years old.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Excuse me; I interrupt you
again. You, yourself—can you state here that this tree was actually
cut down from the grave and not from any other place in the
clearing?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I can say only that in the Katyn wood there were
some clearings with small trees and that, while driving back to
Smolensk, we took a little tree with us in the bus, but I do not know
whether there were any graves where these trees were standing.
As I have already stated, no graves were laid open in our presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I would request you to continue
your reply, but very briefly and not to detain the attention of the
Tribunal with unnecessary details.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Some editorial notes were made in connection with
this protocol, but I do not remember what they were. Then Orsos
<span class='pageno' title='347' id='Page_347'></span>
and Butz were entrusted with the final drafting of the record. The
signing of the record was intended to take place on the same night
at a banquet which was organized in a German Army hospital. At
this banquet Butz arrived with the minutes and he started reading
them, but the actual signing did not take place for reasons which
are still not clear to me. It was stated that this record would have
to be rewritten, so the banquet lasted until 3 or 4 o’clock in the
morning. Then Professor Palmieri told me that the Germans were
not pleased with the contents of the protocol and that they were
carrying on telephone conversations with Berlin and that perhaps
there would not even be a protocol at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Indeed, having spent the night in Smolensk without having
signed the record, we took off from Smolensk on the morning of
1 May. I personally had the impression that no protocol at all
would be issued and I was very pleased about that. On the way to
Smolensk, as well as on our way back, some of the delegates asked
to stop in Warsaw in order to see the city, but we were told that it
was impossible because of military reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: This has nothing to do with the
subject. Please keep to the facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Around noon we arrived at the airport which was
called Bela. The airport was apparently a military airfield because
of the temporary military barracks I saw there. We had dinner there
and immediately after dinner, notwithstanding the fact that we
were not told that the signing of the minutes would take place on
the way to Berlin, we were submitted copies of the protocol for
signature. During the signing a number of military persons were
present, as there were no other people except military personnel on
this airfield. I was rather struck by the fact that on the one hand
the records were already completed in Smolensk but were not submitted
to us for signing there, and on the other hand that they did
not wait till we arrived in Berlin a few hours later. They were
submitted to us for signing at this isolated military airfield. This
was the reason why I signed the report, in spite of the conviction
I had acquired during the autopsy which I had performed at
Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: That is to say, the date and the
locality which are shown in the protocol are incorrect?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, that is so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: And you signed it because you
felt yourself compelled to?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, I don’t think it is proper for
you to put leading questions to him. He has stated the fact. It is
useless to go on stating conclusions about it.
<span class='pageno' title='348' id='Page_348'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Very well, Mr. President. I have
no further questions to put to the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Does anyone want to cross-examine him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I should like to ask a question
concerning the legal proceedings first. Each side was to call three
witnesses before the Court. This witness, as I understand it, has not
only testified to facts but has also made statements which can be
called an expert judgment. He has not only expressed himself as
an expert witness, as we say in German law, but also as an expert.
If the Court is to listen to these statements made by the witness as
an expert, I should like to have the opportunity for the Defense also
to call in an expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal will not hear
more than three witnesses on either side. You could have called any
expert you wanted or any member of the experts who made the
German examination. It was your privilege to call any of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, how long have you been active in the
field of medical jurisprudence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I have been working in the field of medical jurisprudence
since the beginning of 1927 in the faculty for medical jurisprudence
of the University in Sofia, first as an assistant and now
I am professor of medical jurisprudence. I am not a staff professor
at the university. My position can be designated by the German
word “Ausserordentlicher Professor” (university lecturer).</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Before your visit to Katyn did your government
tell you that you were to participate in a political action without
consideration of your scientific qualification?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I was not told so literally, but in the press the Katyn
question was discussed as a political subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you feel free in regard to your scientific
“conscience” at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: At what time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: At the time when you went to Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The question is not quite clear to me; I should like
you to explain it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you consider the task you had to carry out
there a political one or a scientific one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I understood this task from the very first moment as
a political one and therefore I tried to evade it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you realize the outstanding political importance
of this task?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes; from everything I read in the press.
<span class='pageno' title='349' id='Page_349'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In your examination yesterday you said that
when you arrived at Katyn the graves had already been opened
and certain corpses had been carefully laid out. Do you mean to say
that these corpses were not taken from the graves at all?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: No, I should not say that, inasmuch as it was obvious
that corpses were taken out of these graves and besides I saw that
some corpses were still in the graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, in order to state this positively, you had
no reason to think that the corpses inspected by the commission
were not taken from these mass graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He did not know where they came from,
did he?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Evidently from the graves which were open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: You have already made statements to the effect
that, as a result of the medico-judicial examination by this International
Commission, a protocol, a record was taken down. You
have furthermore stated that you signed this protocol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, this protocol is contained in its full text in the
official data published by the German Government on this incident.
I ask that this evidence, this so-called <span class='it'>White Book</span>, be admitted as
evidence. I will submit it to the Court later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal rules that you may
cross-examine this witness upon the report, and the protocol will
be admitted in evidence, if you offer it in evidence, under Article 19
of the Charter. That, of course, involves that we do not take judicial
notice of the report under Article 21 of the Charter but that it is
offered under Article 19 of the Charter and therefore it will either
come through the earphones in cross-examination or such parts of
the protocol as you wish to have translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, was the protocol or the record signed
by you and the other experts compiled in the same way in which
it is included in the German <span class='it'>White Book</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, the record of the protocol which is included in
the German <span class='it'>White Book</span> is the same protocol which I compiled. A
long time after my return to Sofia I was sent two copies of the
protocol by Director Dietz. These two copies were typewritten, and
I was requested to make necessary corrections and additions if I
deemed it necessary, but I left it without corrections and it was
printed without any comments on my part.
<span class='pageno' title='350' id='Page_350'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Just a moment Dr. Stahmer...</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I believe that there is a slight confusion here. The
witness is answering in regard to the individual protocol, whereas
Dr. Stahmer is questioning him on the general record. Thus the
witness does not answer the proper question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I would have cleared this matter
up on my own account.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Do you mean your autopsy protocol?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I mean the protocol I compiled myself and not the
general record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Now, what about this general protocol or record?
When did you receive a copy of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I received a copy of the general record in Berlin
where as many copies were signed as there were delegates present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Just a little while ago you stated that Russian
witnesses had been taken before the commission in the wood of
Katyn, but that, however, there had been no opportunity afforded
the experts to talk with these witnesses concerning the question at
hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, in this protocol, in this record, the following remark is
found, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The commission interrogated several indigenous Russian witnesses
personally. Among other things, these witnesses confirmed
that in the months of March and April 1940 large
shipments of Polish officers arrived almost daily at the railroad
station Gnjesdova near Katyn. These trains were
emptied, the inmates were taken in lorries to the wood of
Katyn and never seen again. Furthermore, official notice was
taken of the proofs and statements, and the documents containing
the evidence were inspected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: As I already stated during the questioning, two witnesses
were interrogated on the spot by Orsos. They actually said
that they saw how Polish officers were brought to the station of
Gnjesdova and that later they did not see them again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal thinks the witness
ought to be given an opportunity of seeing the report when you
put passages in it to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Haven’t you got another copy of it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I am sorry, Mr. President, I have no second
copy; no.
<span class='pageno' title='351' id='Page_351'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can the witness read German?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: No, but anyhow I can understand the contents of the
record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean you can read it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, I can also read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can the witness read German, do you mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, I can read German.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, may I make a suggestion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, if you have only got one copy,
I think you had better have it back. You can’t have the book
passing to and fro like that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I should like to make the suggestion that the
cross-examination be interrupted and the other witness be called,
and I will have this material typed in the meantime. That would
be a solution. But there are only a few sentences...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can read it. Take the book back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I propose to read only a few
short sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Yesterday you testified, Witness, that
the experts restricted or limited themselves to making an autopsy
on one corpse only. In this report the following is set down—I
quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The members of the commission personally performed an
autopsy on nine corpses and numerous selected cases were
submitted for post-mortem examination.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: That is right. Those of the members of the commission
who were medical experts, with the exception of Professor
Naville, performed each an autopsy on a corpse. Hajek made two
autopsies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In this instance we are not interested in the
autopsy, but in the post-mortem examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The corpses were examined but only superficially
during an inspection which we carried out very hastily on the first
day. No individual autopsy was carried out, but the corpses were
merely looked at as they lay side by side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I should like to ask you now what is meant in
medical science by the concept “post-mortem examination.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We differentiate between an exterior inspection,
when the corpse has to be undressed and minutely examined externally,
and an internal inspection, when the inner organs of the
<span class='pageno' title='352' id='Page_352'></span>
corpse are examined. This was not done with the hundreds of bodies
at Katyn, as it was not physically possible. We were there only
one forenoon. Therefore, I consider that there was no actual medico-judicial
expert examination of these corpses in the real sense of
the word.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: A little while ago you talked about the trees
that were growing there on these graves, and you said that an
expert explained the age of the trees by the rings counted on a
trunk. In the protocol and the report the following is set down.
I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“According to the opinion of the members of the commission
and the testimony of forest ranger Von Herff, who was called
in as an expert on forestry, they were small pine trees of at
least 5 years of age, badly developed because they had been
standing in the shade of large trees and had been transplanted
to this spot about 3 years ago.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I would like to ask you, is it correct that you undertook
a local inspection and that you convinced yourself on the spot
whether the statements made by the forestry expert were actually
correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Our personal impression and my personal conviction
in this question only refer to the fact that in the wood of Katyn
there were clearings where small trees were growing and that the
afore-mentioned expert showed us a cross section of a tree with
its circles. But I do not consider myself competent and cannot give
an opinion as to whether the deductions which are set forth in the
record are correct or not. Precisely for that reason it was judged
necessary to call in a forestry expert, for we doctors were not competent
to decide this question. Therefore, these conclusions are
merely the conclusions of a competent German expert.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: But after having had a first-hand view, did you
doubt the truth of these statements?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: After the German expert had expressed his opinion
at the conference of the delegates, neither I nor the other delegates
expressed any opinion as to whether his conclusions were correct
or not. These conclusions are set down in the record in the form
in which the expert expressed himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: According to your autopsy report the corpse of
the Polish officer which you dissected was clothed and you described
the clothing in detail. Was this winter or summer clothing that
you found?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: It was winter clothing including an overcoat and a
woolen shawl around the neck.
<span class='pageno' title='353' id='Page_353'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In the protocol it says further and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Furthermore, Polish cigarettes and matchboxes were found
with the dead; in some cases tobacco containers and cigarette
holders, and ‘Kosielsk’ was inscribed thereon.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The question is, did you see these objects?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We actually saw these tobacco boxes with the name
“Kosielsk” engraved thereon. They were exhibited to us in the
glass case which was shown to us in the peasant hut not far from
the Katyn wood. I remember them because Butz drew our attention
to them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In your autopsy report, Witness, there is the
following remark, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In the clothing documents were found and they were put in
the folder Number 827.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I should like to ask you: How did you discover these documents?
Did you personally take them out of the pockets?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: These papers were in the pockets of the overcoat
and of the jacket. As far as I can remember they were taken out
by a German who was undressing the corpse in my presence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: At that time were the documents already in the
envelope?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: They were not yet in the envelope, but after they
had been taken out of the pockets they were put into an envelope
which bore the number of the corpse. We were told that this was
the usual method of procedure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What was the nature of the documents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I did not examine them at all, as I have already
said, and I refused to do so, but according to the size, I believe that
they were certificates of identity. I could distinguish individual
letters, but I do not know whether one could read the inscription,
for I did not attempt to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In the protocol the following statement is made,
and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The documents found with the corpses (diaries, letters, and
newspapers) were dated from the fall of 1939 until March and
April 1940. The latest date which could be ascertained was
the date of a Russian newspaper of 22 April 1940.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I should like to ask you if this statement is correct and
whether it is in accordance with the findings that you made?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Such letters and newspapers were indeed in the glass
cases and were shown to us. Some such papers were found by members
of the commission who were dissecting the bodies, and if I
<span class='pageno' title='354' id='Page_354'></span>
remember rightly, they described the contents of these documents,
but I did not do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In your examination just a little while ago you
stated that only a few scientific details were contained in this protocol
and that this was probably done intentionally. I should like
to quote from this record as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Various degrees and types of decomposition were caused by
the position of the bodies to one another in the grave. Aside
from some mummification on the surface and around the
edges of the mass of corpses, some damp maceration was
found among the center corpses. The sticking together of the
adjacent corpses and the soldering together of corpses through
cadaverous acids and fluids which had thickened, and particularly
the deformations that obtained from the pressure
among the corpses, show that the corpses were buried there
right from the beginning.</p>

<p>“Among the corpses, insects or remains of insects which might
date back to the time of burial are entirely lacking, and from
this it may be gathered that the shooting and the burial took
place at a season which was cold and free from insects.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now, I should like to ask you if these statements are correct
and if they are in line with your findings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I stated that little was said on the condition of the
corpses, and indeed as can be judged by the quotation which I had
in mind, only a general phraseology is used concerning the various
degrees of decomposition of the corpses, but no concrete or detailed
description of the condition of the corpses is made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to the insects and their larvae, the assertion of the general
report that none were discovered is in flagrant contradiction to the
conclusions of Professor Palmieri, which are recorded in his personal
minutes concerning the corpse which he himself dissected. In this
protocol, which is published in the same German White Book, it is
said that there were traces of remains of insects and their larvae
in the mouths of the corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Just a little while ago you spoke of the scientific
examination of skulls undertaken by Professor Orsos. The
record also refers to this matter, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“A large number of skulls were examined with respect to the
changes they had undergone, which, according to the background
and experience of Professor Orsos, would be of great
value in fixing the date of death. In this connection, we are
concerned with stratified encrustations on the surface of the
mush found in the skull as a residue of the brain. These
symptoms are not to be found among corpses which have
<span class='pageno' title='355' id='Page_355'></span>
been in their graves for less than 3 years. Such a condition,
among other things, was found in a very decided form in the
skull of corpse Number 526, which was found near the surface
of a large mass grave.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to ask you now if it is correct that, according to
the report of Professor Orsos, such a condition was discovered not
only as is said here on the skull of one corpse, but among other
corpses also.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I can answer this question quite categorically. We
were shown only one skull, the one precisely mentioned in the
record under the Number 526. I do not know that other skulls were
examined, as the record seems to imply. I am of the opinion that
Professor Orsos had no possibility of examining many corpses in
the Katyn wood, for he came with us and left with us. That means
he stayed in the Katyn wood just as long as I and all the other
members of the commission did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Finally, I should like to quote the conclusion of
the summarizing expert opinion, in which it is stated:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“From statements made by witnesses, from the letters and
correspondence, diaries, newspapers, and so forth, found on
the corpses, it may be seen that the shootings took place in
the months of March and April 1940. The following are in
complete agreement with the findings made with regard to
the mass graves and the individual corpses of the Polish
officers, as described in the report.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Is this statement actually correct?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I did not quite understand the statement. As
I heard you read it, it was something like this: From the statements
of witnesses, letters, and so forth ...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: “...in complete agreement with the findings
made with regard to the mass graves and the individual corpses of
the Polish officers and described in the report.” That is the end of
the quotation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It doesn’t say that the following persons are
in complete agreement, but that the following facts are in complete
agreement. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No. My question is: “Is this statement approved
by you? Do you agree with it?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, I know, but you read out certain words,
which were these: “The following are in complete agreement.” What
I want to know is whether that means that the following persons
are in complete agreement, or whether the following facts are in
complete agreement.
<span class='pageno' title='356' id='Page_356'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Special facts had been set down, and this is a
summarizing expert opinion signed by all the members of the commission.
Therefore, we have here a scientific explanation of the real
facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would you just listen to what I read out
from what I took down? “From the statements of witnesses,
letters, and other documents, it may be seen that the shooting took
place in the months of March and April 1940. The following are
in complete agreement.” What I am asking you is this—</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Dr. Stahmer attempted to interrupt.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Just a moment, Dr. Stahmer, listen to what I say. What I am
asking you is: Does the statement mean that the following persons
are in complete agreement, or that the following facts are in complete
agreement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No, no. The following people testify that this
fact, the fact that the shootings took place in the months of March
and April 1940, agrees with the results of their investigations of the
mass graves and of individual corpses. That is what is meant and
that is the conclusion. What has been found here is in agreement
with that which has been set down and determined scientifically.
That is the meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Is this final deduction in accord with your
scientific conviction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I have already indicated that this statement regarding
the condition of the corpses is based on the date resulting from
testimony by the witnesses and from the available documents, but
it is in contradiction to the observations I made on the corpse which
I dissected. That means I did not consider that the results of the
autopsies corroborated the presumable date of death to be taken
from the testimony or the documents. If I had been convinced that
the condition of the corpses did indeed correspond to the date of
decease mentioned by the Germans, I would have given such a
statement in my individual protocol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When I saw the signed protocol I became suspicious as to the last
sentence of the record—the sentence which precedes the signatures.
I always had doubts whether this sentence was contained in that
draft of the protocol which we saw at the conference in Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as I could understand, the draft of the protocol which had
been elaborated in Smolensk only stated that we actually were
shown papers and that we heard witnesses; and this was supposed
to prove that the killings were carried out in March or April of 1940.
<span class='pageno' title='357' id='Page_357'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I was of the opinion that the fact that the conclusion was not
based on medical opinion and not supported absolutely by medical
reports and examination, was the reason why the signing of the
protocol was postponed and why the record was not signed in
Smolensk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, at the beginning of my examination
you stated that you were fully aware of the political significance of
your task. Why, then, did you desist from protesting against this
report which was not in accord with your scientific conviction?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I have already said that I signed the protocol as I was
convinced that the circumstances at this isolated military airfield
offered no other possibility, and therefore I could not make any
objections.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Why did you not take steps later on?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: My conduct after the signing of the protocol corresponds
fully to what I am stating here, I repeat. I was not convinced
of the truth of the German version. I was invited many times to
Berlin by Director Dietz. I was also invited to Sofia by the German
Embassy. And in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian Foreign Office also
invited me to make a public statement over the radio and to the
press; and I was requested to say what conclusions we had come
to during our investigation. However, I did not do so, and I always
refused to do so. Because of the political situation in which we
found ourselves at that moment, I could not make a public statement
declaring the German version was wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning that matter there were quite sharp words exchanged
between me and the German Embassy in Sofia. And when, a few
months later, another Bulgarian representative was asked to be
sent as a member of a similar commission for the investigation of
the corpses in Vinnitza in the Ukraine, the German Ambassador
Beckerly stated quite openly to the Bulgarian Foreign Office that
the Germans did not wish me to be sent to Vinnitza.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That indicated that the Germans very well understood my
behavior and my opinion on that matter. Concerning this question,
Minister Plenipotentiary Saratov, of our Foreign Office, still has
shorthand records about conversations which, if the Honored Tribunal
considers it necessary, can be sent here from Bulgaria.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, all my refusals, after I had signed the protocol, to
carry on any activity for the purpose of propaganda, fully correspond
to what I said here, namely that the conclusions laid down
in the collective protocol do not answer my personal conviction.
And I will repeat that if I had been convinced that the corpses
were buried for 3 years, I would have testified this after having
dissected a corpse. But I have left my personal protocol incomplete
<span class='pageno' title='358' id='Page_358'></span>
and this is a quite unusual thing in the case of medico-judicial
examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The protocol was not signed by you alone, but
on the contrary it carries the signatures of 11 representatives of
science, whose names you gave yesterday, some of them of world
renown. Among these men we find a scientist of a neutral country,
Professor Naville.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Did you take the opportunity to get in touch with one of these
experts in the meantime with a view of reaching a rectification of
the report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I cannot say on what considerations the other
delegates signed the protocol. But they also signed it under the
same circumstances as I did. However, when I read the individual
protocols, I notice that they also refrained from stating the precise
date of the killing of the man whose corpse they had dissected.
There was one exception only, as I have already said. That was
Professor Miloslavich, who was the only one who asserted that the
corpse which he had dissected was that of a man buried for at least
3 years. After the signing of the protocol, I did not have any
contact with any of the persons who had signed the collective
protocol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Witness, you gave two versions, one in the
protocol which we have just discussed, and another here before
the Court. Which version is the correct one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I do not understand which two versions you are
speaking about. Will you please explain it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In the first version, in the protocol, it is set
forth that according to the conclusion which had been made, the
shooting must have taken place 3 years ago. Today you testified
that the findings were not correct, and between the shooting and
the time of your investigations there could only be a space of
perhaps 18 months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I stated that the conclusions of the collective protocol
do not correspond with my personal conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: “Did not correspond” or “do not correspond with
your conviction”?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: It did not and it does not correspond with my opinion
then and now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no further questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no further
questions to put to this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Witness, were any of the bodies which were
examined by the members of this delegation exhumed from the
ground in your presence?
<span class='pageno' title='359' id='Page_359'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: The corpses which we dissected were selected among
the top layers of the graves which had been already exhumed. They
were taken out of the graves and given to us for dissection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was there anything to indicate, in your
opinion, that the corpses had not been buried in those graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: As far as traces are concerned, and as far as the
layers of corpses were preserved, they were stuck to each other; so
that if they had been transferred, I do not believe that this could
have been done recently. This could not have been done immediately
before our arrival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean that you think the corpses had
been buried in those graves?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I cannot say whether they were put into those
graves immediately after death had come, as I have no data to
confirm this, but they did not look as if they had just been put there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it possible, in your opinion as an expert,
to fix the date of March or April or such a short period as that,
3 years before the examination which you have made?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I believe that if one relies exclusively on medical
data, that is to say, on the state and condition of the corpses, it is
impossible, when it is a question of years, to determine the date
with such precision and say accurately whether they were killed in
March or in April. Therefore, apparently the months of March and
April were not based on the medical data, for that would be
impossible, but on the testimony of the witnesses and on the documents
which were shown us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When you got back to Sofia, you said that
the protocol was sent to you for your observations and for your
corrections and that you made none. Why was that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: We are concerned with the individual protocol which
I compiled. I did not supplement it by making any conclusion, I did
not add any conclusion because it was sent to me by the Germans
and because in general at that time the political situation in our
country was such that I could not declare publicly that the German
version was not a true one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean that your personal protocol
alone was sent to you at Sofia?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, only my personal protocol was sent to Sofia.
As to the collective protocol, I brought that back myself to Sofia
and handed it over to our Foreign Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is your personal protocol, in the words that
you drew it up, incorporated in the whole protocol and signed by
all the delegates?
<span class='pageno' title='360' id='Page_360'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: In my personal protocol there is only a description
of the corpse and of the clothing of the corpse which I dissected.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is not the question I asked.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: In the general protocol a rough description only is
made, concerning the clothing and the degree of decomposition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, do you mean that your personal
protocol...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: I consider that the personal protocols are more
accurate regarding the condition of the corpses, because they were
compiled during the dissection and were dictated on the spot to
the stenographers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just listen to the question, please. Is your
personal protocol, in the words in which you drew it up, incorporated
in the collective protocol in the same words?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: My own protocol is not included in the general
record, but it is included in the <span class='it'>White Book</span> which the Germans
published together with the general record.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is there, then, in the report, is it? It is
in the <span class='it'>White Book</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARKOV: Yes, quite right. It is included in this book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire. Yes, Colonel Smirnov,
do you have another witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Yes, Mr. President. I beg you
to allow me to call as a witness, Professor of Medical Jurisprudence
Prosorovski.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Prosorovski took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VICTOR IL’ICH PROSOROVSKI (Witness): Prosorovski, Victor
Il’ich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me:</p>

<p class='pindent'>I, citizen of the U.S.S.R.—called as a witness in this case—solemnly
promise and swear before the High Tribunal—to say all
that I know about this case—and to add and withhold nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Witness, just before questioning
you, I beg you to adhere to the following order. After my question,
please pause in order to allow the interpreters to make the translation,
and speak as slowly as possible.
<span class='pageno' title='361' id='Page_361'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Will you give the Tribunal very briefly some information about
your scientific activity, and your past work as a medico-judicial
doctor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I am a doctor by profession; professor of
medical jurisprudence and a doctor of medical science. I am the
Chief Medical Expert of the Ministry of Public Health of the Soviet
Union. I am the Director of the Scientific Research Institute for
Medical Jurisprudence at the Ministry of Public Health of the
U.S.S.R.; my business is mainly of a scientific nature; I am President
of the Medico-Judicial Commission of the Scientific Medical Council
of the Ministry of Public Health of the U.S.S.R.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How long did you practice as a
medico-judicial expert?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I practiced for 17 years in that sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What kind of participation was
yours in the investigation of the mass crimes of the Hitlerites
against the Polish officers in Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: The President of the Special Commission for
investigation and ascertaining of the circumstances of the shootings
by the German Fascist aggressors of Polish officers, Academician
Nicolai Ilych Burdenko, offered me in the beginning of January 1944
the chairmanship of the Medico-Judicial Commission of experts.
Apart from this organizational activity, I participated personally in
the exhumations and examination of these corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Colonel Smirnov, perhaps that would be a
good time to break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='362' id='Page_362'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE MARSHAL: May it please the Tribunal, the Defendants
Hess, Fritzsche, and Von Ribbentrop are absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: May I continue the examination
of this witness, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me, how far from the
town of Smolensk were the burial grounds where the corpses were
discovered?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: A commission of medico-legal experts, together
with members of the special commission, Academician Burdenko,
Academician Potemkin, Academician Tolstoy, and other members of
this commission, betook themselves on 14 January 1944 to the burial
grounds of the Polish officers in the so-called Katyn wood. This
spot is located about 15 kilometers from the town of Smolensk.
These burial grounds were situated on a slope at a distance of about
200 meters from the Vitebsk high road. One of these graves was
about 60 meters long and 60 meters wide; the other one, situated a
small distance from this first grave, was about 7 meters long and
6 meters wide.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How many corpses were exhumed
by the commission you headed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In the Katyn wood the commission of medical
experts exhumed and examined, from various graves and from
various depths, altogether 925 corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How was the work of exhumation
done and how many assistants were employed by you on this
work?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Specialists and medico-legal experts participated
in the work of this commission. In September and October
1943 they had exhumed and examined the corpses of the victims
shot by the Germans...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Where was the examination of
the corpses performed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: They examined them in the town and the
neighborhood of Smolensk. Among the members of this commission
were Professor Prosorovski; Professor Smolianinov; the eldest and
most learned collaborator of the Medico-Legal Research Institute,
Dr. Semenovski; Professor of Pathological Anatomy Voropaev; Professor
of Legal Chemistry Schwaikova, who was invited for consultations
on chemico-legal subjects. To assist this commission, they
<span class='pageno' title='363' id='Page_363'></span>
called also medico-legal experts from the forces. Among them were
the medical student Nikolski, Dr. Soubbotin...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I doubt whether the Tribunal is
interested in all these names. I ask you to answer the following
question: What method of examination was chosen by you? What
I mean is, did you strip the corpses of their clothes and were you
satisfied with the customary post mortem examination or was every
single one of these 925 corpses thoroughly examined?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: After exhumation of the corpses, they were
thoroughly searched, particularly their clothing. Then an exterior
examination was carried out and then they were subjected to a
complete medico-legal dissection of all three parts of the body; that
is to say, the skull, the chest, and the abdomen, as well as all the
inner organs of these corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Please tell me whether the corpses
exhumed from these burial grounds bore traces of a previous
medical examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Out of the 925 corpses which we examined, only
three had already been dissected; and that was a partial examination
of the skulls only. On all the others no traces of previous
medical examination could be ascertained. They were clothed; and
the jackets, trousers, and shirts were buttoned, the belts were
strapped, and the knots of ties had not been undone. Neither on the
head nor on the body were there any traces of cuts or other traces
of medico-legal examination. Therefore this excludes the possibility
of their having been subjected to any previous medico-legal examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the medico-legal examination
which was carried out by your commission, did you open the
skulls?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Of course. At the examination of quite a number
of corpses the skull was opened and the contents of the skull
were examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Are you acquainted with the
expression “pseudocallus?”</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I heard of it when I received a book in 1945
in the Institute of Medico-Legal Science. Before that not a single
medical legal expert observed any similar phenomena in the Soviet
Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Among the 925 skulls which you
examined, were there many cases of <span class='it'>pseudocallus</span>?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Not one of the medico-legal experts who were
examining these 925 corpses observed lime deposits on the inner
side of the cranium or on any other part of the skull.
<span class='pageno' title='364' id='Page_364'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, there was no sign of
<span class='it'>pseudocallus</span> on any of the skulls.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Was the clothing also examined?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: As already stated, the clothing was thoroughly
examined. Upon the request of the Special Commission, and in the
presence of its members and of the Metropolitan Nikolai, Academician
Burdenko, and others, the medico-legal experts examined
the clothing, the pockets of the trousers, of the coats, and of the
overcoats. As a rule, the pockets were either turned, torn open, or
cut open, and this testified to the fact that they had already been
searched. The clothing itself, the overcoats, the jackets, and the
trousers as well as the shirts, were moist with corpse liquids. This
clothing could not be torn asunder, in spite of violent effort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, the tissue of the
clothing was solid?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, the tissue was very solid, and of course,
it was besmeared with earth.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the examination, did you
look into the pockets of the clothing and did you find any documents
in them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: As I said, most of the pockets were turned out
or cut; but some of them remained intact. In these pockets, and also
under the lining of the overcoats and of the trousers we discovered,
for instance, notes, pamphlets, papers, closed and open letters and
postcards, cigarette paper, cigarette holders, pipes, and so forth, and
even valuables were found, such as ingots of gold and gold coins.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: These details are not very relevant,
and therefore I beg you to refrain from giving them. I would
like you to answer the following question: Did you discover in the
clothing documents dated the end of 1940 and also dated 1941?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes. I discovered such documents, and my
colleagues also found some. Professor Smolianinov, for instance,
discovered on one of the corpses a letter written in Russian, and it
was sent by Sophie Zigon, addressed to the Red Cross in Moscow,
with the request to communicate to her the address of her husband,
Thomas Zigon. The date of this letter was 12 September 1940.
Besides the envelope bore the stamp of a post office in Warsaw of
September 1940, and also the stamp of the Moscow post office, dated
28 September 1940.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Another document of the same sort was discovered. It was a
postcard sent from Tarnopol, with the post office cancellation: “Tarnopol,
12 September 1940.”
<span class='pageno' title='365' id='Page_365'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we discovered receipts with dates, one in particular with
the name—if I am not mistaken—of Orashkevitch, certifying to the
receipt of money with the date of 6 April 1941, and another receipt
in his name, also referring to a money deposit, was dated 5 May 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, I myself discovered a letter with the date 20 June 1941,
with the name of Irene Tutchinski, as well as other documents of
the same sort.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: During the medico-legal examination
of the corpses, were any bullets or cartridge cases discovered?
Please tell us what was the mark on these cartridge cases? Were
they of Soviet make or of foreign make; and if they were foreign
make, which one, and what was the caliber?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: The cause of death of the Polish officers was
bullet wounds in the nape of the neck. In the tissue of the brain
or in the bone of the skull we discovered bullets which were more
or less deformed. As to cartridge cases, we did indeed discover,
during the exhumation, cartridge cases of German origin, for on
their bases we found the mark G-e-c-o, Geco.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One minute, Witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now read an original German document and I beg the permission
of the Tribunal to submit a series of documents which have
been offered us by our American colleagues, Document Number
402-PS, Exhibit USSR-507. It concerns German correspondence and
telegrams on Katyn, and these telegrams are sent by an official of
the Government General, Heinrich, to the Government of the
Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submit the original document to the Court. I am only going
to read one document, a very short one, in connection with the
cartridge cases discovered in the mass graves. The telegram is
addressed to the Government of the Government General, care of
First Administrative Counsellor Weirauch in Kraków. It is marked:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Urgent, to be delivered at once, secret.</p>

<p>“Part of the Polish Red Cross returned yesterday from Katyn.
The employees of the Polish Red Cross have brought with
them the cartridge cases which were used in shooting the victims
of Katyn. It appears that these are German munitions.
The caliber is 7.65. They are from the firm Geco. Letter follows.”
signed—“Heinrich.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] Were the cartridge cases and cartridges
which were discovered by you of the same caliber and did they
bear the mark of the same firm?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: As I have already stated, the bullets discovered
in the bullet wounds were 7.65 caliber. The cases discovered during
the exhumation did indeed bear the trademark of the firm Geco.
<span class='pageno' title='366' id='Page_366'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I now ask you to describe in
detail the condition of the body tissues and of the inner organs of
the corpses exhumed from the graves of Katyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: The skin and the inner organs of the corpses
were well preserved. The muscles of the body and of the limbs had
kept their structure. The muscles of the heart had also kept their
characteristic structure. The substance of the brain was, in some
cases, putrified; but in most cases, it had kept its structural characteristics
quite definitely, showing a clear distinction between the
gray and white matters. Changes in the inner organs were mainly
a sagging and shrinking. The hair from the head could be easily
pulled out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: From the examination of the
corpses, to what conclusion did you come as to the date of death
and date of burial?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: On the basis of the experience I have gained
and on the experiences of Smolianinov, Semenovski, and other members
of the commission...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: One moment, Witness. I would
like you to tell the Tribunal briefly what these experiences were and
how many corpses were exhumed. Did you personally exhume them
or were they exhumed in your presence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In the course of the great War, I was often
medico-legal expert during the exhumation and the examination of
corpses of victims who were shot by the Germans. These executions
occurred in the town of Krasnodar and its neighborhood, in
the town of Kharkov and its neighborhood, in the town of Smolensk
and its neighborhood, in the so-called extermination camp of Maidanek,
near Lublin, so that all told more than 5,000 corpses were
exhumed and examined with my personal co-operation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Considering your experience and
your objective observations, to what conclusions did you arrive as
to the date of the death and the burial of the victims of Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: What I have just said applies to me as well as
to many of my colleagues who participated in this work. The commission
came to the unanimous conclusion that the burial of the
Polish officers in the Katyn graves was carried out about 2 years
before, if you count from January, the month of January 1944—that
is to say that the date was autumn 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Did the condition of the corpses
allow the conclusion that they were buried in 1940, objectively
speaking?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: The medico-legal examination of the corpses
buried in the Katyn wood, when compared with the modifications
<span class='pageno' title='367' id='Page_367'></span>
and changes which were noticed by us during former exhumations
on many occasions and also material evidence, allowed us to come
to the conclusion that the time of the burial could not have been
previous to the autumn of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Therefore, the year 1940 is out
of question?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, it is completely excluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: If I understood you rightly you
were also medico-legal expert in the case of other shootings in the
district of Smolensk?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In the district of Smolensk and its environs I
have exhumed and examined together with my assistants another
1,173 corpses, besides those of Katyn. They were exhumed from
87 graves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: How did the Germans camouflage
the common graves of the victims which they had shot?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In the district of Smolensk, in Gadeonovka, the
following method was used:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The top layer of earth on these graves was covered with turf,
and in some cases, as in Gadeonovka, young trees were planted
as well as bushes; all this with a view to camouflaging. Besides,
in the so-called Engineers’ Garden of the town of Smolensk, the
graves were covered with bricks and paths were laid out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: So you exhumed more than
5,000 corpses in various parts of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: What were the causes of death
of the victims in most cases?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In most cases the cause of death was a bullet
wound in the head, or in the nape of the neck.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Were the causes of death at
Katyn similar to those met with in other parts of the Soviet Union?
I am speaking of mass-shootings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: All shootings were carried out by one and the
same method, namely, a shot in the nape of the neck, at pointblank
range. The exit hole was usually on the forehead or in the face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I will read the last paragraph
of your account on Katyn, mentioned in the report of the Extraordinary
Soviet State Commission:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The commission of the experts emphasizes the absolute uniformity
of the method of shooting the Polish prisoners of
<span class='pageno' title='368' id='Page_368'></span>
war with that used for the shootings of Soviet prisoners of
war and Soviet civilians. Such shootings were carried out on
a vast scale by the German Fascist authorities during the
temporary occupation of territories of the U.S.S.R., for instance,
in the towns of Smolensk, Orel, Kharkov, Krasnodar
and Voroneszh.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Do you corroborate this conclusion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes, this is the typical method used by the
Germans to exterminate peace-loving citizens.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: I have no further questions to
put to this witness, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Where is your permanent residence, Witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I was born in Moscow and have my domicile
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How long have you been in the Commissariat
for Health?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I have been working in institutions for public
health since 1931 and am at present in the Ministry of Public
Health. Before that I was a candidate for the chair of forensic
medicine at Moscow University.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: In this commission were there also foreign
scientists?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In this commission there were no foreign
medico-legal experts, but the exhumation and examination of these
corpses could be attended by anybody who was interested. Foreign
journalists, I believe 12 in number, came to the burial grounds
and I showed them the corpses, the graves, the clothing, and so
on—in short everything they were interested in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were there any foreign scientists present?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I repeat again that no one was present apart
from Soviet experts of the medico-legal commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Can you give the names of the members of the
press?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, he was giving a long list of
names before and he was stopped by his counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Why do you shake your head?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I did not understand, Mr. President, the one
list of names. He gave a list of names of the members of the commission.
My question is that: The witness has just said that members
of the foreign press were present and that the results of the
investigation were presented to them. I am now asking for the
names of these members of the foreign press.
<span class='pageno' title='369' id='Page_369'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Will you please give me the names of the members
of the press, or at least the names of those who were present
and to whom you presented the results of the examination?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Unhappily I cannot give you those names now
here; but I believe that if it is necessary, I would be able to find
them. I shall ascertain the names of all those foreign correspondents
who were present at the exhumation of the corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The statement about the number of corpses
exhumed and examined by you seems to have changed somewhat
according to my notes, but I may have misunderstood. Once you
mentioned 5,000 and another time 925. Which figure is the correct
one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: You did not hear properly. I said that 925
corpses had been exhumed in the Katyn wood, but in general I
personally exhumed or was present at the exhumation of over 5,000
in many towns of the Soviet Union after the liberation of the territories
from the Germans.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Were you actually present at the exhumation?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How long did you work at these exhumations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: As I told you, on 14 January a group of
medico-legal experts left for the site of the burial grounds together
with the members of a special commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you not just say how long it took—the
whole exhumation? In other words, to shorten it, can you not say
how long it took?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Very well. The exhumation and part of the
examination of the corpses lasted from 16 to 23 January 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you find only Polish officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: All the corpses, with the exception of two
which were found in civilian clothing, were in Polish uniforms
and were therefore members of the Polish Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you try to determine from what camp these
Polish officers came originally?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: That was not one of my duties. I was concerned
only with the medico-legal examination of the corpses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: You did not learn in any other way from what
camp they came?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In the receipts which were found, dated 1941,
it was stated that the money was received in camp 10-N. It can
<span class='pageno' title='370' id='Page_370'></span>
therefore be assumed that the camp number was obviously of particular
importance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you know of the Kosielsk Camp?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Only from hearsay. I have not been there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Do you know that Polish officers were kept
prisoners there?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I can say only what I heard. I heard that
Polish officers were there, but I have not seen them myself nor
have I been anywhere near there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Did you learn anything about the fate of these
officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: Since I did not make the investigations, I cannot
say anything about the fate of these officers. About the fate
of the officers, whose corpses were discovered in the graves of
Katyn, I have already spoken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: How many officers did you find altogether in
the burial grounds at Katyn?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: We did not separate the corpses according to
their rank; but, in all, there were 925 corpses exhumed and
examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Was that the majority?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: The coats and tunics of many corpses bore
shoulder straps with insignia indicating officers’ rank. But even
today I could not distinguish the insignia of rank of the Polish
officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: What happened to the documents which were
found on the Polish prisoners?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: By order of the special commission the searching
of the clothing was done by the medico-legal experts. When
these experts discovered documents they looked them through, examined
them, and handed them over to the members of the special
commission, either to Academician Burdenko or Academician
Tolstoy, Potemkin, or any other members of the commission.
Obviously these documents are in the archives of the Extraordinary
State Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Are you of the opinion that from the medical
findings regarding the corpses the time when they were killed can
be determined with certainty?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: In determining the date on which these corpses
had presumably been buried, we were guided by the experience
which we had gathered in numerous previous exhumations and also
found support by material evidence discovered by the medico-legal
<span class='pageno' title='371' id='Page_371'></span>
experts. Thus we were able to establish beyond doubt that the
Polish officers were buried in the fall of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I asked whether from the medical findings you
could determine this definitely and whether you did so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROSOROVSKI: I can again confirm what I have already said.
Since we had great experience in mass exhumations, we came to
that conclusion, in corroboration of which we also had much
material evidence, which enabled us to determine the autumn of
1941 as the time of the burial of the Polish officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no more questions to put to this witness.
Mr. President, an explanation regarding the document which was
just submitted; I have here only a copy signed by Heinrich; I have
not seen the original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I imagine the original is there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Colonel Smirnov, do you want to re-examine?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I have no further
questions to put to this witness; but with the permission of the
Tribunal, I would like to make a brief statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We were allowed to choose from among the 120 witnesses whom
we interrogated in the case of Katyn, only three. If the Tribunal
is interested in hearing any other witnesses named in the reports
of the Extraordinary State Commission, we have, in the majority
of cases, adequate affidavits which we can submit at the Tribunal’s
request. Moreover, any one of these persons can be called to this
Court if the Tribunal so desires.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all I have to say upon this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have no objection to the further presentation
of evidence as long as it is on an equal basis; that is, if I, too,
have the opportunity to offer further evidence. I am also in a
position to call further witnesses and experts for the Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has already made its order;
it does not propose to hear further evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal wishes to hear Dr. Bergold with reference to
finishing the case of the Defendant Bormann, and the Tribunal
also understands that counsel for the Defendant Von Neurath has
some documents which he wishes to present.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, have you some documents for Von Neurath?
<span class='pageno' title='372' id='Page_372'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you present them now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Mr. President, I have here two
types of documents. One type includes the documents which I have
already offered in presenting my evidence, and to which I have
called the attention of the Court. They are all in the document
books which have been submitted to the Court, and I believe it will
be sufficient to hand these documents to the General Secretary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Lüdinghausen, you have already offered
them in evidence and they all have numbers, have they not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Then I have a number of documents,
probably 12 or 15, which have also been included in my
document books, in translation. However, I have not yet mentioned
these documents in my presentation recently, and have not yet
asked the Court to take judicial notice of them. If I may refer
to them briefly, they are as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>A letter from Von Neurath to Hitler of 19 June 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A copy of the minutes of the withdrawal of the Inter-Allied
Military Commission in 1926.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A speech...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you kindly give them the exhibit
numbers which they are to have as you offer them in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The first one is a letter to Hitler of 19 June
1933. What number will that letter have?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: That is Number 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 32, minutes on the withdrawal of the Inter-Allied
Military Commission.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 50, a speech of Prime Minister MacDonald of 16 March
1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 51, an article of Von Neurath on the League of Nations,
in the periodical <span class='it'>Der Völkerbund</span> of 11 May 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 52, Hitler’s speech of 17 May 1933, the so-called “Peace
Speech.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 53, a statement of the German Ambassador Nadolny,
in Geneva, of 19 May 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 54, a statement of the American representative,
Norman Davies, at the Disarmament Conference, of 22 May 1933.
<span class='pageno' title='373' id='Page_373'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 55, a statement of the German Ambassador Nadolny,
at the Disarmament Conference of 27 May 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 81, a speech by the then Minister Beneš of 2 July 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 82, an excerpt from the speech of Marshal Pétain of
22 July 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 83, the communiqué of the Reich Government of
26 July 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 85, the communiqué of the Reich Government of 10 September
1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 86, a speech of Herr Von Neurath of 17 September 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 88, excerpts from the speech of Marshal Smuts of
12 November 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 119, a statement of the British Minister in the House
of Commons of 20 July 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Those are the documents which I had not yet named, but which
are already contained in my document books. Mr. President, may
I take this opportunity to submit the following application, namely:
The Court...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Those documents have all been translated,
have they not, Dr. Lüdinghausen?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes, they are all included, in translation,
in the document books which have been submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, may I now make an application to the Court? It
is to the effect that the Court should permit me to call again the
Defendant Von Neurath to the witness stand, for the following
reason. As may be recalled, in the course of cross-examination Sir
David Maxwell-Fyfe presented Document 3859-PS to the defendant,
which document was a photostatic copy of a letter from the defendant,
dated 31 August 1940, to the Chief of the Reich Chancellery,
Lammers, with two enclosures. In this letter the defendant asked
Lammers to submit the two enclosures to Hitler and to arrange, if
possible, a personal conference or an interview on the question of
alleged Germanization mentioned therein. The two enclosures of
this letter to Lammers are reports and suggestions on the future
form of the Protectorate and concern the assimilation or possible
Germanization of the Czech people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Court will recall that the presentation of this rather extensive
document—it has 30 or 40 pages in this photostatic form if not
more—surprised the defendant, and at that moment he could not
recall the matter clearly enough to give positive and exhaustive
information about these documents immediately. Nevertheless, in
cross-examination, after a very brief look at these reports, he expressed
doubts as to whether these reports, as presented here in
photostatic form, were actually identical with the reports which
<span class='pageno' title='374' id='Page_374'></span>
were enclosed, according to his instructions, in the letter to Lammers
to be submitted to Hitler. A careful examination of these
photostatic copies was not possible in the course of cross-examination;
and, of course, I myself, since I did not know the documents,
was not able to comment upon them. Since Herr Von Neurath was
obviously overtired and exhausted after the cross-examination it
was not possible for me to examine the question and discuss it with
him on the same day; that was possible only on the following day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, the defendant
may be recalled for the purpose of being questioned about these
two documents; but, of course, it is an exceptional license which is
allowed on this occasion, because the object of re-examination is to
enable counsel to elucidate such matters as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may call him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The Defendant Von Neurath resumed the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>You are still under oath, of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Herr Von Neurath, do you recall
the reason for your letter to Dr. Lammers of 31 August 1940 and
your request for him to arrange a conference, an interview with
Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Yes. As I said during my examination, in the
course of the summer of 1940 I learned that various Reich and Party
agencies, among others particularly the Gauleiter of the neighboring
Gaue and Himmler, had sent more or less radical reports and suggestions
to Hitler. I knew that Himmler, particularly, made quite
extreme suggestions regarding a partition of the Protectorate area
and complete annihilation of the Czech folkdom and people. These
agencies were urging Hitler to put these plans into effect as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since, as I have already emphasized, I was opposed to such plans
and, on the contrary, wanted to preserve the Czech people and folkdom
and protect them against the intentions of Himmler and his
companions to destroy them, I decided to make an attempt to induce
Hitler not to carry out any Germanization plans but to forbid them
and to send a categorical order to this effect to the Party and its
agencies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Do you recall how these two reports
came about, which were to be included in your letter to Lammers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: As far as I can recall, things developed as follows:
Either I myself dictated a report or one of my officials drew
it up according to my instructions; I believe the latter was the case.
But I recall definitely that this report was much briefer than the
<span class='pageno' title='375' id='Page_375'></span>
one submitted here in photostatic copy. I remember, furthermore,
that the conclusions drawn in it were similar but much sharper and
that the whole problem had to be considered very carefully.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Now, tell us how and why the
second report of Frank came to be made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: From the various discussions which I had with
Frank, I knew that he, too, was opposed to this partition of the
Protectorate territory and the evacuation of the Czech population
as proposed by Himmler and that he shared my opinions, at least
to that extent. Therefore I considered it expedient, since Hitler had
assigned Frank to me as State Secretary because he knew the
Czech country and people very well, to point out to Hitler that this
man, too, was opposed to Himmler’s plans and advised Hitler against
accepting them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: But for what reason did you especially
emphasize in your letter to Lammers that you shared the
opinions expressed in Frank’s report?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I considered it right to do this because Frank
was a member of the SS and a subordinate and confidant of Himmler.
On the other hand, I knew already at that time that Hitler was
prejudiced against me, because of my attitude toward the Czech
people, which he considered much too mild and lenient; and I was,
therefore, convinced that together with Frank I would be more
likely to be successful in influencing Hitler to my way of thinking
than if I went to him alone. That was the reason why I suggested
that Frank should participate in the report. For the same reason
I did not write directly to Hitler, as I did usually, but to Lammers.
According to previous experience, I had to assume that if I had
written directly to Hitler, who on top of it was not in Berlin at the
time, he would either not read the report at all or would refer it
to Himmler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: How was this letter to Lammers
and its enclosures handled in your office?</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: I had the draft of the report of Frank submitted
to me. Then I dictated my letter to Lammers, and I sent it
with my report and Frank’s draft back to Frank’s office for a final
review of the Frank report and for the dispatch of the letter to
Lammers together with both versions. I did not see the letter to
Lammers and the two reports again before they were sent out nor
did I see them, by the way, in Berlin at the conference with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: The last question. How did you
reach the conviction that the photostatic copies, submitted here, of
the two reports could not be identical with the reports which were
enclosed in the letter to Lammers, according to your instructions?
<span class='pageno' title='376' id='Page_376'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: As for the first report which I prepared, I have
already stated that according to my recollection it was much shorter
than the one submitted here in photostatic copy. Furthermore, this
photostatic copy does not bear my signature, not even my initials.
But it is out of the question that the final copy of this report, which
was enclosed at my office in the letter to Lammers, would not have
been signed or at least initialed by me; and the certificate of correctness,
which, remarkably enough, is contained in this report and
which was prepared by an SS Obersturmbannführer, is not signed.
The photostatic copy which is said to have been enclosed in the
letter to Lammers does not even bear my initials. The most noticeable
thing, however, is the certificate of correctness on the photostatic
copy. This can have a meaning only if the document enclosed
in the letter to Lammers, in spite of not bearing my signature, was
enclosed in the letter nevertheless. But since the final copy which
my office sent to State Secretary Frank’s office with the letter to
Lammers was certainly signed by me, this certificate proves that it
was not the report signed by me which was enclosed in the letter
sent to Lammers but another one drafted by Frank or by officials
in his office. As for Frank’s own report, the text of the photostatic
copy here, to my recollection, is not identical with the text of the
report which I approved and which I then sent on together with my
report to Lammers...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Von Lüdinghausen, we have heard the
explanation more than once, I think, that the enclosure which was
in the letter was not the same as the one which he drew up. It does
not get any more convincing by getting told over again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: I only wanted to express it again.
But if the Tribunal believes that that explanation has been made
previously, I may dispense with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>VON NEURATH: Mr. President, may I be permitted to make
another statement as to how I imagine—of course, I can only
imagine—these things took place? I am firmly convinced that if
the two photostatic copies submitted here were actually enclosed in
the letter to Lammers, they were prepared in Frank’s office, and
enclosed without my knowledge. Another possibility would be, of
course, that Czech...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We are quite as able to imagine possibilities
as you are.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The fact is that the letter was signed in his name, was it not?
The letter itself was signed?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And he refers expressly to the enclosure?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes.
<span class='pageno' title='377' id='Page_377'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well; we understand it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. VON LÜDINGHAUSEN: Yes. I wanted it to be made clear
to the Court. For, as I have said, I could not thoroughly examine
the remarkable characteristics of these two reports, the outer form
and the text at the moment of cross-examination. I have no further
questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then the defendant can return to the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do you want to ask any questions, Sir David?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, I do not think so. If
the Court would just allow me, I should like to look at the document
while the Court is recessed and see whether there is any point
that I might like to question on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will recess now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I have considered the matter;
and I think it is really in the stage of argument and not cross-examination;
but, My Lord, I should like Your Lordship just to
observe, as the matter has been raised, that there is a certificate,
given by Captain Hochwald on behalf of General Ecer, which states
that the exhibit which was put in is a photostat taken from the
original of a document found in the archives of the Reich Protector’s
office in Prague, so that that theory appears, from the certificate and
the exhibit, that the copy-letter to Dr. Lammers and the two memoranda
were preserved and found in the office of the Reich Protector.
I do not want to say anything further in the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let the defendant come back to the witness
box. Oh—no he need not come back. Dr. Bergold. Dr. Bergold?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Mr. President, since
Dr. Bergold is absent at present, I should like to ask whether I may
submit the three documents in my case which are still outstanding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Dr. Kranzbühler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: I am offering as Exhibit
Dönitz-100, the affidavit subscribed by the chief of the American
Navy, Admiral Nimitz, as to American U-boat war against the
Japanese Navy. The Tribunal already knows what I wish to prove
with this. I need not read anything now because in the final presentation
of my argument I shall have to come back to this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal would like to have the document
read, Dr. Kranzbühler.
<span class='pageno' title='378' id='Page_378'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: I have the original text
in English, Mr. President, and I shall therefore have to read in
English:</p>

following interrogatories were on this date, 11 May 1940, put

<p>“2. Q: ‘Did the U.S.A. in her sea warfare against Japan
announce certain waters to be areas of operation, blockade,
danger, restriction, warning, or the like?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes. For the purpose of command of operations against
Japan the Pacific Ocean areas were declared a theater of
operations.’</p>

<p>“3. Q: ‘If yes, was it customary in such areas for submarines
to attack merchantmen without warning, with the exception
of her own and those of her Allies?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, with the exception of hospital ships and other
vessels under “safe conduct” voyages for humanitarian purposes.’</p>

<p>“4. Q: ‘Were you under orders to do so?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The Chief of Naval Operations on 7 December 1941
ordered unrestricted submarine warfare against Japan.’</p>

<p>“5. Q: ‘Was it customary for the submarines to attack Japanese
merchantmen without warning—outside of announced
operation or similar areas since the outbreak of the war?’
<span class='pageno' title='379' id='Page_379'></span></p>

<p>“A: ‘The reply to this interrogatory involves matters outside
the limits of my command during the war; therefore I make
no reply thereto.’</p>

<p>“6. Q: ‘Were you under orders to do so?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The reply to this interrogatory involves matters outside
the limits of my command during the war; therefore I make
no reply thereto.’</p>

<p>“7. Q: ‘If the practice of attacking without warning did not
exist since the outbreak of the war, did it exist from a later
date on? From what date on?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The practice existed from 7 December 1941 in the declared
zone of operations.’</p>

<p>“8. Q: ‘Did this practice correspond to issued orders?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes.’</p>

<p>“9. Q: ‘Did it become known to the U.S. naval authorities
that Japanese merchantmen were under orders to report any
sighted U.S. submarine to the Japanese Armed Forces by
radio? If yes, when did it become known?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘During the course of the war, it became known to the
U.S. naval authorities that Japanese merchantmen in fact
reported by radio to Japanese Armed Forces any information
regarding sighting of U.S. submarines.’</p>

<p>“10. Q: ‘Did the U.S. submarines thereupon receive the order
to attack without warning Japanese merchantmen, if this
order did not exist already before? If yes, when?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The order existed from 7 December 1941.’</p>

<p>“11. Q: ‘Did it become known to the U.S. naval authorities
that the Japanese merchantmen were under orders to attack
any U.S. submarine in any way suitable according to the
situation; for instance, by ramming, gunfire, or by depth
charges? If yes, when did it become known?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Japanese merchantmen were usually armed and always
attacked by any available means when feasible.’</p>

<p>“12. Q: ‘Did the U.S. submarines thereupon receive the
order of attacking without warning Japanese merchantmen,
if this order did not already exist before. If yes, when?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The order existed from 7 December 1941.’</p>

<p>“13. Q: ‘Were, by order or on general principles, the U.S.
submarines prohibited from carrying out rescue measures
toward passengers and crews of ships sunk without warning
in those cases where by doing so the safety of their own
boat was endangered?’
<span class='pageno' title='380' id='Page_380'></span></p>

<p>“A: ‘On general principles, the U.S. submarines did not
rescue enemy survivors if undue additional hazard to the
submarine resulted or the submarine would thereby be
prevented from accomplishing its further mission. U.S. submarines
were limited in rescue measures by small passenger-carrying
facilities combined with the known desperate and
suicidal character of the enemy. Therefore, it was unsafe to
pick up many survivors. Frequently survivors were given
rubber boats and/or provisions. Almost invariably survivors
did not come aboard the submarine voluntarily, and it was
necessary to take them prisoner by force.’</p>

<p>“14. Q: ‘If such an order or principle did not exist, did the
U.S. submarine actually carry out rescue measures in the
above-mentioned cases?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘In numerous cases enemy survivors were rescued by
U.S. submarines.’</p>

<p>“15. Q: ‘In answering the above question, does the expression
“merchantmen” mean any other kind of ships than those
which were not warships?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘No. By “merchantmen” I mean all types of ships which
were not combatant ships. Used in this sense, it includes
fishing boats, et cetera.’</p>

<p>“16. Q: ‘If yes, what kind of ships?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The last answer covers this question.’</p>

<p>“17. Q: ‘Has any order of the U.S. naval authorities mentioned
in the above questionnaire concerning the tactics of
U.S. submarines toward Japanese merchantmen been based
on the grounds of reprisal? If yes, what orders?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The unrestricted submarine and air warfare ordered on
7 December 1941 resulted from the recognition of Japanese
tactics revealed on that date. No further orders to U.S.
submarines concerning tactics toward Japanese merchantmen
throughout the war were based on reprisal, although specific
instances of Japanese submarines committing atrocities
toward U.S. merchant marine survivors became known and
would have justified such a course.’</p>

<p>“18. Q: ‘Has this order or have these orders of the Japanese
Government been announced as reprisals?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The question is not clear. Therefore I make no reply
thereto.’</p>

<p>“19. Q: ‘On the basis of what Japanese tactics was reprisal
considered justified?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The unrestricted submarine and air warfare ordered
by the Chief of Naval Operations on 7 December 1941 was
<span class='pageno' title='381' id='Page_381'></span>
justified by the Japanese attacks on that date on U.S. bases
and on both armed and unarmed ships and nationals without
warning or declaration of war.’</p>

<p>“The above record of testimony has been examined by me
on this date and is in all respects accurate and true.”—signed—“Chester
W. Nimitz, Fleet Admiral, U.S. Navy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This document bears the number Dönitz-100.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As my next document I submit an expert opinion given by the
former naval judge, Jäckel, on the jurisdiction of the naval courts
for the protection of the native population against encroachments
by marines. This document has been admitted by the Tribunal and
is available in translation and therefore I do not need to read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you give us the number?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Dönitz-49, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Mr. President, some weeks back I made application to
admit extracts from the records of a war crimes court at Oslo.
These had been used by the Prosecution on the occasion of the
cross-examination of Grossadmiral Dönitz. At that time they were
not numbered. From these records I selected some extracts which
prove that torpedo boat Number 345, whose crew were shot by
reason of the Commando Order, was a boat which was charged
with sabotage acts. Due to this fact the High Command of the
Navy and also Admiral Dönitz were not informed about the treatment
meted out to these prisoners, and this question was settled
directly by means of discussions between Gauleiter Terboven and
the Führer’s headquarters. I ask that the High Tribunal admit this
document as evidence, since this document was used by the Prosecution.
It would receive the Number Dönitz-107.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COLONEL H. J. PHILLIMORE (Junior Counsel for the United
Kingdom): My Lord, I do not know if the Tribunal has before it
the answer which the Prosecution have put into this application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, we have just looked at it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Broadly speaking, it comes to this, that
we are quite prepared to put in the whole proceedings, but we
should object to extracts being put in; that is, amongst the affidavits
and the evidence of some of the witnesses, material to support
the points for which counsel for Defendant Dönitz contends.
There is, on the other hand, a body of evidence the other way on
all those points. That is why, My Lord...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would it not save translation if you put in
the passages in the document upon which you rely?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: If that would be more convenient, My Lord,
we can do that.
<span class='pageno' title='382' id='Page_382'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I do not know how long the document is.
It may be very long indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: The whole proceedings are very long. The
trial lasted for 4 days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then it would be appropriate that you should
pick out the parts on which you rely and Dr. Kranzbühler can
put in...</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, it is put in the answer that the
document against this defendant, which was proved in the defendant’s
case, was an affidavit by the Judge Advocate, who set out
the effect of the evidence accepted by the court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal follows that, but it thinks that
it is desirable that you should put in the passages upon which you
as well as the defense counsel rely.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: May I submit this document,
Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the number again, please?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Number Dönitz-107, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And it contains extracts from these proceedings,
does it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Yes, extracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Prosecution will put in their extracts
and we will consider them both.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Mr. President, then I
have another question dealing with the documents of the case
which we have just dealt with, the case of Katyn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness, Professor Markov, mentioned the expert opinion
given by the Italian expert, Professor Palmieri, which is in the
German <span class='it'>White Book</span>. I should also like to submit this opinion as
evidence, for the reason that there is no mention of insects being
found on the corpses as Professor Markov asserted, but rather,
“larvae.” To me the difference appears to be that insects fly about
during the summer whereas larvae conceal themselves during the
winter months, Mr. President, may I submit this document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, I should like to
make just one factual remark. In Professor Palmieri’s report it
was indicated that the “larvae” were discovered in the throats
of the corpses. I cannot imagine that “insects” were ever found
in the throat of a corpse. That is why I do not think that the presentation
of the document by defendant’s counsel serves a purpose.
<span class='pageno' title='383' id='Page_383'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kranzbühler, you are specifying a particular
document referred to in the <span class='it'>White Book</span>, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And you mean the whole of the document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: That document is about
one page, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then you may put it in, subject to its being
translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Very well, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. COUNSELLOR SMIRNOV: Mr. President, we are talking
about a document which is an account on the dissection of a corpse
performed by Professor Palmieri. It is no report but merely an
account of an autopsy carried out by Professor Palmieri himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it referred to in the conclusions or not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: It is put in the general
record to the same extent as the record of Professor Markov. It
is the findings on the autopsy which Professor Palmieri performed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Mr. President, I have still
another document in the case of Katyn, which I received from
Polish sources just a few days ago. This is a document which was
written in English and appeared in London in 1946. The title is,
<span class='it'>Report on the Massacre of Polish Officers in the Katyn Wood</span>. In
this document Polish sources are used, and I should like to offer
this document to the Tribunal as evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, before I present certain lines of evidence, I would like
to ask that the High Tribunal examine this document, for there
may be doubts whether it can be used as evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kranzbühler, this document is printed
for private circulation only. It has no printer’s name on it, and
it is entirely anonymous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>FLOTTENRICHTER KRANZBÜHLER: Yes, Mr. President, these
were the doubts which I entertained. I submitted this document
as I assumed that in view of the importance of this case, the
Tribunal would nevertheless want to take official notice of the
contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, the Tribunal thinks it would be improper
to look at a document of this nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, I should just like to make one
remark, as in fact the Tribunal has already indicated its decision.
The statement of the defendant’s counsel that this document was
<span class='pageno' title='384' id='Page_384'></span>
received from the Polish Delegation astounds me to say the least.
I should like to know from what Polish Delegation he received
this document, because the Polish Delegation represented here could
not possibly produce such a Fascist propaganda document as this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think General Rudenko misunderstood what
Dr. Kranzbühler said.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, four interrogatories were granted
to me on behalf of the Defendant Funk. When I presented my case,
I could not yet submit these affidavits because they had not been
translated. In the meantime, I have received these translations;
and they have been submitted to the Tribunal. I ask to be permitted
to present them briefly to the Tribunal at this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of them, in Document Book Walter Funk, Supplement
Number 2, will be numbered Exhibit Number Funk-16. This is
the very comprehensive interrogation of the witness Landfried
who held the position of state secretary in the Ministry of the
Defendant Funk. This witness—I do not believe I need to read
this record in detail—in answer to the first question, deals with
the economic policy of the Defendant Funk in the occupied countries.
He describes it in exactly the same way as it was presented
by Funk. In answer to the second question, he deals similarly
with the directions given by the Defendant Funk to the military
commanders and to the Reich Commissioners of the occupied
countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Question 4, the witness deals with the question of the
plundering of the occupied territories. He confirms the fact that
the Defendant Funk always opposed such plundering, that he
fought the black markets, that he opposed devaluation of the currency,
that he tried to maintain currency in the occupied territory
on the original level.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reply to Question 5, the witness describes in detail how the
Defendant Funk tried to prevent financial overburdening of the
occupied countries, especially to lower the costs of occupation as
far as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then in the other questions, in Part 2, particularly in reply to
Question 11, the witness discusses the activities of the Defendant
Funk in the Ministry of Economics, with regard to German preparations
in the event of a war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, in reply to Question 12, the witness examines the position
of the Plenipotentiary General for Economy and he concludes
that in practice it was the position of a figurehead only. However,
I do not wish to read these detailed statements and take up too
much of the time of the Tribunal, for in the main these are only
repetitions of statements that have already been made.
<span class='pageno' title='385' id='Page_385'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the last two questions, Numbers 14 and 15, the witness Landfried,
who, as I have already said, was for years the defendant’s
deputy, describes the defendant’s attitude toward the policy of
terror and his fundamental attitude in regard to the use of foreign
workers and similar matters. I ask that the Tribunal take judicial
notice of this very detailed testimony and that these brief statements
will suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next interrogatory comes from the witness Emil Puhl. This
is the same witness who was interrogated in this courtroom about
other questions, namely the question of gold teeth, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>. This
is the interrogatory and the answers of the witness Emil Puhl,
Document Book Funk, Supplement Number 3, Exhibit Funk-17.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter, has this interrogatory been
granted?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: He gave his evidence. We do not generally
allow interrogatories to witnesses who have given their evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, the matter was like this: As far
back as December I had applied for this interrogatory and repeatedly
asked for it, but it did not arrive. And only after 2 days of
cross-examining, was this witness Emil Puhl suddenly questioned
by the Prosecution on entirely different subjects, that is the matter
of gold deposits made by the SS, rather of gold teeth. This interrogation
by the Prosecution did not refer to the interrogatory,
which I believe was granted by you in February.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter, what I mean is this: Supposing
the Tribunal is asked to grant an interrogatory and it grants the
interrogatory, and then the witness is subsequently called to give
evidence. When he is called to give evidence, he ought to be
questioned upon all the matters which are relevant to the Trial.
The Tribunal does not want to have to read his evidence in one
place and then his interrogatory in some other place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Is there any objection, Mr. Dodd, to accepting it in this case?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: No, I have no objection, Mr. President. That is the
situation. It was granted before Puhl was called. He was called
here for cross-examination and I do not recall offhand whether
or not counsel inquired concerning these matters that are contained
therein. We have no objections. It may be some annoyance
to the Tribunal, which we regret.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, the witness Puhl, during his
examination in the French camp, also had the questions of the
cross-examination submitted to him which the Prosecution asked
for and they were answered by him. Thus he was interrogated
not only about the points which I raised, but also about the
<span class='pageno' title='386' id='Page_386'></span>
questions put in the cross-examination by the Prosecution. Therefore,
I take the liberty of submitting this document, which is an
interrogatory of Emil Puhl, Document Book Number 3, Supplement
Number 3, and to which is assigned Exhibit Number Funk-17.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This witness Puhl, who was the vice president of the Reichsbank,
in this interrogatory deals solely with matters entirely
different from the subjects dealt with here in his examination,
namely, the preparations which the Reichsbank President, Dr. Funk,
made in the event of war; that is Question Number 1, concerning
the handling of the clearing debts, and Question Number 2, about
the higher valuation of the Danish currency...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal thinks you need not read the
interrogatory but the Tribunal will allow it to go in in this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Thank you, Mr. President. I wanted only to
sketch the contents of this testimony briefly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I submit additional testimony, given by a witness, which
has been granted by the Tribunal. It is the testimony given by
the witness Heinz Kallus, to be found in Document Book Walter
Funk, Supplement 4, and is assigned Exhibit Number Funk-18. I
also submit this testimony to the General Secretary and I should
like to ask, in order to save time, that the Tribunal take judicial
notice of its contents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As my fourth and last document there is an affidavit subscribed
by Mr. Messersmith, a supplement to a previous statement which
has already been submitted to the Tribunal. This is very brief,
in fact it is but one sentence and it may be found in the Document
Book Walter Funk, Supplement Number 5, with Exhibit Number
Funk-19. I also submit this document. And now I have arrived
at the conclusion of my report, Mr. President. Thank you very
much.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Mr. President, I should like to submit to the
Tribunal the testimony of the witness Dr. Beil. Up to now I had
received this testimony only in English. I have fetched it again
from the Translation Division so that I could submit it as Exhibit
Number Rosenberg-50. In this connection I have another request.
This interrogatory contains important questions dealing with the
attitude adopted by the East Ministry in the matter of allocation
of labor and it is of such importance that I ask the permission
of the Tribunal to have it read. Since I am not entirely
conversant with the English language, I should like to ask to have
an interpreter read this interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, has this document been offered
in evidence before: It was granted by the Tribunal, was it not,
this interrogatory?
<span class='pageno' title='387' id='Page_387'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Yes, it has already been granted by the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is it necessary to read it? Can you not submit
it in evidence and the Tribunal will consider it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I leave that, of course, to the Tribunal to decide.
I wanted to point out only that this is very important and decisive
testimony in regard to the question of manpower allocation in the
East Ministry. However, I shall leave that to the judgment of
the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you not summarize it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Mr. President, I have received only an English
translation, and I do not wish to attempt to do anything with it.
But I believe there are only 2 pages—the interpreter will read
that in no time at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Let the interpreter read it then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>INTERPRETER: Exhibit Number Rosenberg-50:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Copy. Completed interrogatory of Ministerialrat Dr. Beil,
on behalf of Rosenberg.</p>

<p>“The witness, having been duly sworn, states:</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Were you the permanent official (Sachbearbeiter) in the
East Ministry (Ost Ministerium) in charge of the questions
of labor and social policy?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, I was one of 10 permanent officials; we originally
started with 52, but as the East Front receded the staff was
finally reduced to 10. I was in charge of the administration
side of the labor and social policy. The head of the department
was Landesbauernführer Peukert.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Was the East Ministry in favor of voluntary recruiting
of workers in the East?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, of voluntary recruiting only, my instructions being
that it should only be carried out on this basis.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Are any results known?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, but the results were not as great as anticipated,
only some 300,000 to 400,000 volunteered and most of these
were from the Ukraine, Lithuania, and Estonia.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Were there any negotiations about decreasing the quotas
ordered by the Plenipotentiary General for Allocation of
Labor (GBA)?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, negotiations for decreasing the quotas took place
but broke down owing to Sauckel demanding something like
a million workers to be transferred to the interior.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Who was responsible for the care and control of the
East Workers (Ostarbeiter) in the Reich?’
<span class='pageno' title='388' id='Page_388'></span></p>

<p>“A: ‘The German Labor Front (Arbeitsfront) and the Reich
Food Estate (Reichsnährstand) were responsible for the care
of the East Workers, the former for workers in munitions
and heavy industry and the latter for agricultural workers.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘What was the point of view of the Department ASO...’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: ASO, if I may interrupt, is the Labor, Social, and
Political Department of the East Ministry.</p>

<p class='pindent'>INTERPRETER: [<span class='it'>continuing.</span>]</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Q: ‘What was the point of view of the Department ASO
concerning the treatment of the East Workers in the Reich?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The view of my Department ASO was that the voluntary
recruiting of workers on a free movement basis, thus
taking them out of the barbed-wire-enclosed factories, would
be the best method of treatment; we also advocated the
removal of the arm badges, worn originally on the arm and
later over the left breast, which carried the word “East” so as
to distinguish them from workers from the West, who never
at any time wore badges. The wording being later changed to
“Greater Russia,” “White Russia,” and “Ukraine,” the people
from the Baltic States did not wear the arm badge. Certain
Russians, small groups of Cossacks, Tartars, and one or two
others were not compelled to wear the arm band, as they
were anti-Bolshevistic and pro-German; and a certain proportion
of these were eventually called up into the German
Army. Some 7,000 youths of Ruthenia were called up by
ASO and these were apprenticed at Junkers Works.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Is the Central Office (Zentralstelle) for the eastern people
(Ostvölker) at the East Ministry known to you? How was this
organized?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, it was considered to be a consulate for the East;
members of the staff were partly Germans and partly local
employees from the East, who were considered suitable for
such employment. Some of the foreign employees were placed
at the disposal of the country offices to look after the interests
of their fellow countrymen working in the countries. At the
Central Office were instituted offices for each of the eastern
states, each office being controlled by a German, some of
whom had originally come from these states. There was also
a welfare branch which was run by persons from these eastern
states, to look after the comfort, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>, of their individual
countrymen; there was also a religious branch which was run
by clergy from these countries, but this branch was not very
successful as there was an insufficiency of priests.’
<span class='pageno' title='389' id='Page_389'></span></p>

<p>“Q: ‘Now, with the help of the DAF, were the complaints followed
up?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘The interests of foreign workers were always looked after;
missions were sent to the various concentrations of East Workers
to find out how they were progressing and what kind of
treatment they were receiving. These missions dealt with complaints
submitted to them on their visits, but the Central Office
had to deal also with written complaints received through the
post.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Is a printed circular to the authorities in the country
known to you, that ordered a just treatment? Details? What
was the story about the families who were evacuated by the
Army Group Center and about the children 10-14 years old?’</p>

<p>“A: ‘Yes, there was a circular issued, dealing with this question,
and it gave details at great length for the just treatment
of the East Workers. This circular was issued at the request
of the Ministry of the East, through Sauckel. A second circular
was issued by Rosenberg dealing with the just treatment
of workers from the East only. I have no knowledge of
this story, as this was dealt with entirely by the Army Group
Center.’</p>

<p>“Q: ‘Does the witness know the pamphlet issued by the East
Ministry to the managers of enterprises concerning the nations
of eastern Europe and the attitude towards them?’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, that affidavit does not seem to be
short at all. It all seems to be cumulative. Every word of it is what
we have heard before and heard not only once, but over and over
again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>INTERPRETER: Dr. Thoma has just said that the last sentence
is coming up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: There are two more short sentences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>INTERPRETER:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“A: ‘There were two pamphlets issued; one issued by Sauckel,
and the other issued in conjunction with DAF and Sauckel

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Thoma, the Tribunal rely on counsel, you
know; and when you tell us that this is an important affidavit, we
rely on what you tell us. In the opinion of the Tribunal, the reading
of the affidavit was an absolute waste of the Tribunal’s time.
<span class='pageno' title='390' id='Page_390'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: I should like to put another request to the Tribunal.
I have asked that I be granted an interrogatory for the Reichshauptstellenleiter
Dr. Oeppert, of the office of the Delegate of the
Führer for the supervision of the entire ideological and mental
relation of the NSDAP under Rosenberg’s office. This affidavit has
not been granted to me, but I already have it on hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has the Prosecution seen it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: No, Mr. President, I do not think so. I submitted
an application to the General Secretary. Whether this request has
already been transmitted to the Prosecution, I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the only application that we have got,
as far as I can see, is an interrogatory to Dr. Köppen in lieu of
Dr. Stellbrecht. Is that the one that you are speaking about now?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: No. Mr. President, I was granted permission to
interrogate Dr. Köppen instead of Dr. Stellbrecht, and the interrogatory
has already been sent off. This, however, is a new application
regarding Dr. Oeppert and has not yet been decided upon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You had better submit it to the Prosecution
and see whether they have any comment to make on it, and we can
take it up tomorrow.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Thank you very much, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: In the case of Papen there are six interrogatories
which have not been disposed of. Three of them have
been returned in the last few days and are in the stage of being
translated. I asked, when I received my last interrogatory, to be
allowed to submit all six at one time to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, without my taking any steps to get it, I received an affidavit
3 days ago from a foreign journalist, Rademacher von Unna,
from Milan, Italy. This affidavit is being translated at present. I
submitted it to the British prosecutor, and he does not object. I ask
to be allowed to submit this affidavit later with the remainder of
my documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly you may submit it. We shall
then pass an opinion upon it as to its admissibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KUBUSCHOK: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED SEIDL (Counsel for Defendants Frank and Hess):
Mr. President, I ask permission to submit the answers to the interrogatories
from the witnesses which have not yet been submitted.
As Exhibit Frank-19 I submit the answers to the interrogatory given
by the witness Dr. Ernst Böpple. Böpple was State Secretary in the
Government General, and he has answered 41 questions in all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Number Frank-20, I submit the answers to an interrogatory
given by the witness Max Meidinger. Meidinger was chief of the
<span class='pageno' title='391' id='Page_391'></span>
chancellery of the Government General. He has answered 43 questions.
This interrogatory, as well as the first interrogatory by Böpple,
as far as I could make out, has not been translated yet, although I
handed these interrogatories in to be translated about 10 days ago.
But attached to the interrogatory there is an English translation
which was made during the interrogation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Number Frank-21 I submit the answers given by the witness
Gassner, who answered 49 questions. Gassner was press chief in
the Government General.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number Frank-22 will be the interrogatory deposed by the witness
Dr. Stepp, who in the end was president of the Court of Appeals
(Oberlandesgericht). He deals mainly with the efforts made by the
Defendant Frank in the years 1933 and 1934, in his capacity as
Bavarian Minister of Justice, for the dissolution of the concentration
camp at Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should also like to take this opportunity, Mr. President, of
pointing out an error of translation which does not refer to the
documents of Frank but to a document which was submitted on
behalf of the Defendant Hess. Although it was not used by the
Prosecution with regard to the personal responsibility of Rudolf
Hess, it is found in the document book, and the document concerned
is Exhibit USA-696, Document 062-PS. That is a directive of
13 March 1940, the same directive which was mentioned last Saturday
in the case of the Defendant Bormann, on which occasion the
President himself read Figure 4 of this directive, which was submitted
as an appendix to this directive of 13 March. There is a
very serious error in translation, which completely distorts the sense
of the directive and which, I must say, can have very dangerous
consequences.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under Figure 4 the words “unschädlich gemacht” (made harmless)
were translated as “liquidated.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If there is an error in the translation, you
had better apply to the General Secretary; and he will have the
matter gone into by the Translation Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Yes, Mr. President, but the matter does not seem to
be as simple as that. The translator obviously had the feeling himself
that his translation was not reproducing the sense quite accurately,
because in parentheses he added “unschädlich gemacht.” In
my opinion this sentence must be translated as follows: “Likewise,
enemy parachutists are immediately to be arrested or made harmless.”
The sense was obviously that the parachutists...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I dare say, Dr. Seidl, but we do not have the
document before us and we do not all of us understand the German
<span class='pageno' title='392' id='Page_392'></span>
language. Therefore, it had better be referred to the Translation
Division. It is no good referring it to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall put a written application to the General
Secretary, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have the Prosecution any objection to these
interrogatories which Dr. Seidl has been dealing with? Have the
Prosecution had the opportunity of putting cross-interrogatories if
they wanted to do so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I am told that we think so, with
the possible exception of the last one. Perhaps I could look into it
overnight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I will look into that point and let the Tribunal
know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the Prosecution have a few documents to put in. I have
eight, and I think my friend Mr. Dodd has three. I could do it very
quickly, but it might be more convenient to do it tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will go into all these documents tomorrow
morning. There will be some others on behalf of some of the other
defendants. We will also hear the witnesses Kempka and Walkenhorst,
I believe it is, whom Dr. Bergold wishes to call.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal desires Dr. Bergold to be here tomorrow morning
in order to be able to examine these witnesses.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will now adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 3 July 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='393' id='Page_393'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTIETH DAY</span><br/> Wednesday, 3 July 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has Dr. Bergold asked any of the defendants’
counsel to represent him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Has the Marshal been able to get in touch with Dr. Bergold?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: No, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, Dr. Bergold was advised yesterday
that his presence would be required in the courtroom today. As
far as I have heard—and I have only heard this—the General
Secretary also got in touch with him regarding this matter. I am
sorry I cannot tell you any more about it. As far as I know, he did
not ask anyone to represent him in Court today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I shall look into this matter
immediately, to see whether he has arrived or whether I can contact
him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very good; and Dr. Stahmer, I think the best
course would be for the Tribunal to consider the various applications
with reference to interrogatories and documents, which I think you
and other counsel wish to offer in evidence, and the Tribunal will
then examine these witnesses if Dr. Bergold is not here by that time.
The Tribunal, of course, expect him to be here if it is possible.
Perhaps you will communicate with him, and the Marshal should
also communicate with Dr. Bergold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DR. HERMANN JAHRREISS (Counsel for Defendant
Jodl): Mr. President, I have learned that the son of Dr. Bergold
returned yesterday unexpectedly and suddenly from a prisoner-of-war
camp. Therefore, Dr. Bergold went to his home, a short distance
from Nuremberg. I asked his secretary to go to Dr. Bergold’s home
and to bring him here and I assume he will be here within approximately
half an hour.
<span class='pageno' title='394' id='Page_394'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, you have some interrogatories,
I think, which you want to offer in evidence, have you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Sir. At the end of my presentation I still
had some interrogatories which I had been permitted to present but
which had not arrived.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, I shall turn to the interrogatory of Kammhuber, who
was a general in the Air Force. He submitted an organizational
study for 1950, which was completed on 2 May 1938. He was questioned
about the purpose and significance of this study and he
stated—I will give a short summary—that a part of it, which came
under the heading of “long term objective” was a tentative sketch
based on theoretical assumptions. Then there was a second part
which gave the deadline of 1942, and the interim solution for
1 October 1938. This was a positive proposal for the organization of
the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This study was compiled by the author on his own initiative. The
witness does not know whether it was actually submitted to Göring.
He considers it improbable, but he does assume that he did suggest
the positive proposal for the organization of the Luftwaffe to Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is the substance of this interrogatory which will be called
Exhibit Number Göring-54.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have another interrogatory which I should like to submit,
which originates from General Kurt Student. This deals with the
air attack on Rotterdam in May of 1940. It is an explanation...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got copies of these affidavits, I
mean these interrogatories? We have got this one you are now
offering of Student, but we have not got the one of Kammhuber.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, I submitted this material to the
Translation Division and I asked that the translations should be
ready. I shall look into the matter and see what has become of it.
At any rate, I did submit the originals to the Translation Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes; the General Secretary will look into it.
And this one of Student, has that been applied for and granted? It
is not on my list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Mr. President, it has been granted, and the
Prosecution has submitted a counterinterrogatory to this one. I
believe...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: If I am not mistaken, this interrogatory of
Student’s was granted on 14 February, if I remember rightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Student deals with the air attack on Rotterdam in May 1940. He
gives the necessary explanation as to how it came about that during
<span class='pageno' title='395' id='Page_395'></span>
capitulation negotiations bombs were still being dropped on Rotterdam.
Here, too, I believe, I can refer to this interrogatory. The facts
were that capitulation negotiations were in progress when an air
attack had been planned and the squadron which was being
employed could not be advised in time by wireless. Then the ground
troops gave signals, which were misunderstood by one group...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It appears that it covers the same ground
that has already been covered in evidence; does it not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It has been dealt with in the examination; yes,
that is correct, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then it should not be read under any circumstances
now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then I shall submit this document...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, offer it in evidence. But I mean, you need
not read it in detail.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well, Mr. President. This will be Exhibit
Number Göring-53.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, Mr. President, I have another interrogatory by a general
of the Air Force, Koller, which I should like to submit. This will be
submitted as Exhibit Number Göring-55.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I ask the permission of the High Tribunal to read
these questions, for there is a special significance connected with the
testimony given by this witness in relation to the defendant in this
proceeding:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 1: Did the former Reich Marshal Göring at any time
issue an order that enemy airmen who had been shot down
should be handed over to the Police, the SD, or that they
should be shot without a trial?</p>

<p>“Answer: As far as I know, no. In any case, I know of no such
order issued by the Reich Marshal.</p>

<p>“Question 2: Did the former Reich Marshal Göring help to
formulate an order on the strength of which the British flying
officers who escaped from Stalag III at Sagan in March 1944
were shot by the Police or SD?</p>

<p>“Answer: General Korten told me that the Luftwaffe, the Air
Force—meaning the Reich Marshal and he, Korten, himself—had
no part in the issuing of this order.</p>

<p>“Question 3: Did the former Reich Marshal Göring learn of
the fact contained in Question 2 only after the order given by
Hitler had been carried out?</p>

<p>“Answer: General Korten told me that he and the Reich
Marshal did not get to know of it until later.
<span class='pageno' title='396' id='Page_396'></span></p>

<p>“Question 4: On what day was this order issued by Hitler?</p>

<p>“Answer: I do not know.</p>

<p>“Question 5: On what day, or on what days, was this order
carried out?</p>

<p>“Answer: I do not know.</p>

<p>“Question 6: Do you know whether the former Reich Marshal
Göring very strongly condemned the shooting of these
50 British Air Force officers?</p>

<p>“Answer: General Korten told me that the Reich Marshal was
very angry about this shooting.</p>

<p>“Question 7: Have you any knowledge as to whether the
former Reich Marshal Göring and his deputy for the Air
Force, the Chief of the General Staff, repeatedly remonstrated
with Hitler about the measures which Hitler had ordered to
be taken against the enemy terror-fliers who had been shot
down?</p>

<p>“Answer: According to statements which General Korten
made to me in June of 1944, that is correct. I remember too
that some time afterward it was reported to me that the
Reich Marshal had complained to the Führer about the action
taken by Party organizations and individuals among the
population against so-called terror-fliers, for the reason that
some of our own air crews had come to harm.</p>

<p>“In March of 1945 he flatly turned down the order given by
the Führer that all enemy crews which had been shot down
and which would be shot down in the future should be turned
over to the SD.</p>

<p>“Replying to Questions 1 to 7, I should like to state in
explanation and in supplement: During the period which is
covered by the report I was Chief of the Luftwaffe Operations
Staff. In February 1944 the Führer’s headquarters transferred
to Berchtesgaden the High Command of the Armed
Forces, the Reich Marshal with his personal entourage and
the Chief of the General Staff of the Air Force, General Korten,
together with two or three ordnance officers. I had to
stay with the High Command of the Luftwaffe, that is, with
the whole working staff known as Robinson, in East Prussia,
as it was expected that the Führer’s headquarters would have
to be moved back quickly. The whole signal apparatus and
the apparatus for the issuing of orders for Luftwaffe supplies
was to be under the control of Robinson.</p>

<p>“Due to the separation of the High Command of the Luftwaffe
on the one hand and the Commander-in-Chief and Chief of General
Staff on the other hand, a separation which was prolonged
<span class='pageno' title='397' id='Page_397'></span>
from week to week, we in East Prussia did not have knowledge
about many things which were being handled directly in
Berchtesgaden. Often we received no knowledge at all of
important Führer directives, or if we did, we received the
information very late. It was not until the beginning of June—I
believe it was the week after Whitsun—that I, together with
some assistant officers, was transferred to Berchtesgaden.
From February until that time, I think I had attended only
one conference at Berchtesgaden.</p>

<p>“As to Questions 2 to 6, which deal with Sagan, it was from
General Korten that I learned, and I believe Colonel Christian
informed me almost at the same time, that the airmen who
had escaped from Sagan had been shot by order of the
Führer. I rather think I heard about it first from General
Korten, who, if I remember rightly, told me about it during
one of the rather long telephone conversations which we had
every evening. Korten made it quite clear that he disapproved
of this, for the reasons which I mentioned in reply to Questions
2, 3, and 6. The conversation must have taken place at the
end of March or the beginning of April. However, I cannot
give the exact date.</p>

<p>“In reply to Questions 1 and 7, concerning the terror-fliers, it
was approximately the beginning of June 1944—at first I
thought that it was in July, but I think now that it must have
been June—when General Korten advised me that the Führer
intended to order that terror-fliers be left to the fury of the
people.</p>

<p>“We discussed this matter repeatedly and we all agreed in our
opposition. We had always considered the direct attacks by
low-flying enemy aircraft on the civilian population, on
women and children, gatherings of civilians, civilian passenger
trains, hospitals, school children who were out for a walk, our
own crews who were parachuting to earth, and farmers who
were tilling their fields, cruel and contrary to international
law, but we did not consider the decree which the Führer
intended to issue to be the proper way to solve this very
difficult problem. Our reasons for this refusal were articles
of war, international law, it was against fundamental soldierly
principles, and it would lead to many misunderstandings
inflicting harm not only to enemy fliers, but also to our own
men and affecting the morale of our own crews...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, is this not really going into
argument and not dealing with facts? It really is not necessary for
you to read all this witness’ arguments about it. He is not really
dealing with facts at all now and it is in detail...
<span class='pageno' title='398' id='Page_398'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, these are the facts which he
discussed with General Korten, the facts which decided them to
reject the Führer’s order. These were the reasons which he and
Korten discussed...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Some of what you have read no doubt is a
matter of fact, but what you are now reading is a matter of argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, surely you can summarize the
rest of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, this document is of great importance
to the defendant because it deals with just those points with
which he is accused and which distress him most and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I heard you say it is of great importance and
therefore you have been reading it and insofar as it is statement of
fact, it seems to me that there is some excuse for reading it in detail.
But when you come to matters of argument, it seems to me there is
no excuse for reading it, because argument by a particular witness
is not really relevant for the Tribunal’s consideration at all. Summarize
the argument, if you like. I mean, you have read the factual
part. Summarize the rest which—maybe you can tell us, if you like,
what the argument is.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well, Mr. President. General Korten
further stated that all the documents which are relevant to the
question of terror-fliers and the shooting of the Royal Air Force
officers have been submitted to him and after perusing them he
arrived at the conclusion that the contents of these documents is
proof of the fact that the High Command of the Armed Forces as
well as the Reich Marshal opposed this action and did everything in
their power to prevent the measure intended by Hitler from being
put into effect. He particularly points out that in one of these letters
there is a marginal note to the effect that it was not possible to get
a reply from the Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, and he
concludes from that that the Reich Marshal personally opposed any
final decision of this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is a further incident dealt with in:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 8: Did the Führer, for the reason stated under
Figure 5, on the occasion of a situation discussion and in the
presence of all who attended it, excitedly accuse the German
Luftwaffe of having made a mutual coward’s agreement with
the Allied Air Forces?</p>

<p>“Answer: During the first half of March 1945, Bormann
showed the Führer a note taken from a correspondent’s report
<span class='pageno' title='399' id='Page_399'></span>
in the Allied press. The gist of this note was: The crew of an
American fighter plane, which shortly before had been shot
down over Germany, had been picked up by advancing
American troops. The crew had testified that the enraged
civilians had mishandled them, had threatened them with
death, and in all probability they would have been lynched
if it had not been for the German soldiers who had liberated
them and protected them. Bormann pointed out to Hitler in
a few words that this confirmed the fact that German soldiers,
in instances such as this, were going against their own
countrymen; and he concluded his remarks somewhat as
follows: ‘My Führer, that is the way your orders are being
carried out.’ Thereupon in the presence of all who attended
the situation discussion the Führer made some very excited
statements and among other things the Führer said to me,
‘If my orders are not being carried out it is due to the
cowardice of the Luftwaffe because the men in the Luftwaffe
are cowards and they are afraid that something might happen
to them, too, some day. The whole business is nothing but a
cowards’ agreement between the German Luftwaffe and the
English and American airmen.’ I reported this to the Reich
Marshal.</p>

<p>“Whether Hitler made the same remark to the Reich Marshal
personally, that I am not able to say; but I consider it quite
probable, because when making reproaches of this kind,
especially if they applied to the Luftwaffe, he often repeated
himself and used the same expressions.</p>

<p>“Question 9: On what day did this discussion take place?</p>

<p>“Answer: I cannot give the date.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now we come to:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 10: Did the Führer repeatedly order the former
Reich Marshal to divulge the name of the officer of the Luftwaffe
who, in May of 1944, protected an Allied airman who
had been shot down in Munich from being lynched by the
population? But despite repeated inquiries on the part of the
Führer, the Reich Marshal gave no instructions to find out
the name of this officer and to make it known to the Führer?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I can summarize the answer. He says he cannot state this from
his own experience; it had only been reported to him that an officer
of the Luftwaffe and an Ortsgruppenleiter had interfered on behalf
of this American crew; that the Ortsgruppenleiter, who was known,
was shot on Hitler’s order; that Hitler then demanded to have the
name of the Luftwaffe officer given to him and that he had not been
told the name. He said further that if the Reich Marshal had actually
<span class='pageno' title='400' id='Page_400'></span>
wanted to find out the name of this Luftwaffe officer, he could easily
have done so.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 11: At the end of the war did the Luftwaffe ever
receive orders to destroy Dachau Concentration Camp with
bombs at the approach of the enemy? In particular, was an
order to that effect given by the Gauleiter in Munich under
the code word ‘Wolke’? Could a Gauleiter give such instructions
to the Luftwaffe?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Here again I can summarize the answer. The witness says,</p>

<p class='pindent'>“I do not recall any order to that effect,” and especially he does
not know whether the Gauleiter in Munich gave such an order. The
Gauleiter was not competent to give an order of this kind and he
does not believe that a senior officer of the Luftwaffe would have
been willing to carry out such an order.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Question 12: What do you know about the attitude of the
Reich Marshal and his Luftwaffe to enemy airmen who had
been shot down?</p>

<p>“Answer: Notwithstanding occasional expressions of displeasure,
the attitude of the Reich Marshal was always correct and
chivalrous, which was in line with the Air Force tradition
which he learned in the first World War and to which he
frequently referred.</p>

<p>“Of course, in his anxiety about the great difficulties of air
defense and pressed by the Führer, perhaps on occasion he
used harsh words. These words, however, were soon forgotten
and I do not know of a single case where the Reich Marshal
followed up these spontaneous utterances by incorrect or
harsh measures or orders against members of foreign air
forces. The conduct of the entire Luftwaffe was always
correct and humane. To fight in a chivalrous manner was a
matter of honor with the German airmen. To quote only a few
examples of many: Although the enemy crews shot at German
airmen who were parachuting to earth, and these practices
were bitterly resented by our airmen and some...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Stahmer. Again, what you are
now reading is all comment; it is not statement of facts, it is comment
and argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Now Mr. President, he is coming to an example
in which he reports about those things.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, let us come to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes. The sea rescue services of the Luftwaffe
from the Bay of Heligoland through the English Channel as far as
Brest, in the Bay of Biscay, in the Atlantic, and in the Mediterranean,
<span class='pageno' title='401' id='Page_401'></span>
was put into use for the enemy in the same way as for the Germans.
The rescue service fliers and the rescue service boats made untiring
efforts and showed exemplary self-sacrifice in going to the rescue
of friend and foe in distress. Even when...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But, Dr. Stahmer, these were not particular
instances. These were not particular facts. They are just general
statements which are really comments and argument about the
chivalry of the German Air Force; that is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, by this he is trying to prove the
chivalry of the German Air Force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But he does not prove it by making a
general statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No. Later on he comes—he will go on to say
how many they have rescued, how many of those were enemies and
how many were their own people. I believe these facts, Mr. President,
are important when judging the attitude of the Luftwaffe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, as I said just now, if you will
get down to the facts, if you have got the numbers, well then, no
doubt that will be a matter of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Of the thousands who were rescued from the sea
by the German Luftwaffe Rescue Service the great majority
belonged to the enemy—members of enemy air crews, crews of
enemy ships. Without being able to give exact figures at the moment,
I would estimate—according to my memory I would say that the
proportion of enemy rescued was from 70 to 80 percent. And he
continues:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“If, when we went out to rescue our own people or to make
reconnaissance flights for them or were engaged on other
work, we saw that crews, also enemy crews, were in distress
off the enemy coast or beyond the range of our own rescue
services, we immediately signaled to the enemy and called
upon him to go to the rescue.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then there are several questions put by the Prosecution. The
first question is: “What had Kaltenbrunner to do with...”</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, it is for the Prosecution to read
their questions if they want to read them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I am not interested in these questions, Mr.
President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: The Prosecution do not want
the questions read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will read them. Do you mean
you want to put them in—put them in evidence?
<span class='pageno' title='402' id='Page_402'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: We will put them in, but we do
not want them read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I have already stated that this is Exhibit
Göring-55.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I have one more interrogatory, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, you realize that the Tribunal
proposes to read all the evidence and therefore these interrogatories
will be read and considered even though they are not read now in
open court. You have offered them in evidence, so the Tribunal will
be grateful if you will cut short the reading of these affidavits and
interrogatories as far as possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I shall proceed accordingly, Mr. President. Now,
we turn to the interrogatory of Hammerstein which I shall submit
as Exhibit Number Göring-52. Mr. President, this interrogatory is
not at my disposal in the original. I can only submit an attested
copy. It has been submitted to the Prosecution; it has been translated
but it cannot be found at the moment. But I assume I shall
find the original very soon; I have advised Sir David of this. The
British Prosecution has already had it and this document has been
translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You mean the original has been mislaid or
something.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: It has been mislaid, Mr. President, and I am
unable to find it at the moment. Anyhow, it has been submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, there is no objection
to this affidavit. I have a copy in front of me. It is general in its
terms and, if I may say so, I thought it would serve its purpose
admirably if Dr. Stahmer put it in and the Tribunal consider it in
due course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The original will be submitted in the next few
days. It is an interrogatory of the Judge Advocate of the Air Force,
Dr. Von Hammerstein. For several years he was the Supreme Judge
of the Air Force and in that capacity he reported once a month to
the Defendant Göring. Thus he was in a position to judge the
attitude of Göring as supreme legal authority and he now describes
in detail how seriously the Defendant Göring took his duties as
supreme legal authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He further describes how the Reich Marshal Göring reserved to
himself the right to decide the more important matters; how he
took great care in dealing with all matters, how he insisted that the
soldiers under his command must maintain strict discipline. He
<span class='pageno' title='403' id='Page_403'></span>
particularly saw to it that the soldiers under his command were
punished most severely if they committed illegal acts against the
civilian population and especially against the civilian population in
the occupied countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he further describes how Reich Marshal Göring demanded
severe punishment particularly when it was a question of violating
the honor of women and how in the many decrees he always insisted
that due respect to the honor of women was the first duty of a
soldier; how in serious cases of rape, he always demanded the death
penalty, no matter what the nationality of the woman was. In two
cases, for instance, he rescinded the sentences because they were too
lenient and he confirmed the sentence only after the death penalty
had been pronounced.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, surely, what you have said, Dr. Stahmer,
has given us the substance of the affidavit. You said that this
man was the Judge Advocate for the Air Force and that the law
with reference to offenses in the Air Force was strictly carried out.
I am sure that is all you want to say in summarizing it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Yes, Mr. President. What I wanted to bring out
was that it did not matter what the nationality of the woman
involved was. In one case against a Russian woman, he...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is exactly what I have said, that the
law was strictly carried out. It is only an illustration of how the
law was strictly carried out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Very well, Mr. President, I have given the
substance. I shall dispense with all further explanation and submit
this document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal thinks that their
time is being wasted, and unless Counsel for the Defense can do
what the Tribunal desires them to do, which is to offer these affidavits
and interrogatories in evidence, giving the shortest possible
summary or description of the affidavits or interrogatories, the
Tribunal will have to order that the interrogatories and affidavits
shall be simply offered in evidence, and they will hear no comment
whatever on them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time is approaching immediately when the defense counsel
are going, to make their speeches, and if there is anything in these
affidavits or interrogatories of real importance, they will have the
opportunity then of commenting upon it. And also, the Tribunal
itself proposes to read not only the oral evidence, but the documentary
evidence in this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Then, Mr. President, I should like to submit this
document under Exhibit Number Göring-52.
<span class='pageno' title='404' id='Page_404'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Now then, the counsel for the Defendant
Von Ribbentrop, Dr. Horn, you have no affidavits or interrogatories
to put in, have you, that have been approved by the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, I ask to be permitted to submit four
affidavits to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are concerned here with the affidavit of Legation Counsellor
Dr. Eberhardt von Thadden. Legation Counsellor Von Thadden was
in the Information Office Number 14 of the Foreign Office, which
was a branch which dealt with the Jewish problem and with the
co-ordination of anti-Semitic propaganda in foreign countries with
other German agencies. It was...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, have you applied for these documents?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: I applied to the General Secretary in writing and I
asked that these affidavits be accepted. This morning I received confirmation
that these affidavits had been given to the Prosecution and
to the Translation Division. Therefore, I beg to submit this document
as Exhibit Number Ribbentrop-319.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A further affidavit which I am submitting, and I have applied to
the General Secretary in writing for its acceptance, is the affidavit
of Dr. Werner Best, the former Reich plenipotentiary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: I am sorry, but I was telling
Dr. Horn that we have not had copies of these yet; they have not
reached us so far.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I have before me a list of four affidavits,
Thadden, Best, Ribbentrop and Schulze, and it is stated that
they are not approved by the Tribunal. Therefore...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, Dr. Horn mentioned
them to me a day or two ago and asked me whether I should object
to their being translated, and I said “no,” that I should not object to
their being translated. Of course, I have not had a chance to see
them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would not the best course, as they have gone
to the Translation Division, be for them to be offered in evidence
now, as I understand Dr. Horn is intending to do, subject, of course,
to any question which may arise as to their admissibility?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, if you will just give us the numbers
then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: The affidavit signed by Best I should like to submit
as Exhibit Ribbentrop-320. I should like to give a brief explanation
of the reason for this affidavit.
<span class='pageno' title='405' id='Page_405'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In cross-examination, my client was confronted with Document
2375-PS. This document is an affidavit of a colonel of the Police,
Dr. Rudolf Mildner. A passage from this affidavit which dealt with
the handling of the Jewish question in Denmark was quoted to my
client. I examined this document and have ascertained that two
documents bear the Number 2375-PS. One document is a statement
made by Dr. Mildner which was not made under oath. This statement
which was not made under oath contained that passage which
was put to my client in cross-examination. Under the same number
there is an affidavit which has been sworn and is also by Dr. Mildner.
The passage about the attitude of Ribbentrop to the Jewish question
is not contained in this affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For this reason, I have got Dr. Best, who had been instructed by
Ribbentrop to handle the Jewish question and, according to Dr.
Mildner, did do so, to give this affidavit, Document Number Ribbentrop-320,
which I am now submitting to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Apart from that my client was confronted in cross-examination
with a series of documents to which he could make
only brief statements as they were lengthy documents, most of which
he had not seen before. I should like to ask the Tribunal to permit
me to submit a few brief explanations on behalf of my client in the
form of an affidavit, which I shall call Exhibit Number Ribbentrop-321.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, I should like to be permitted to define my attitude on
Document TC-75. TC-75 represents a note sent by Ribbentrop to
Hitler. This was submitted by the Prosecution in a very abbreviated
form. When I had this document given to me in the original for
the first time, the photo copy tallied with the copy submitted by the
Prosecution. When I had this same document given to me a second
time, I received a photostatic copy of nine pages. In my final speech
I should like to refer to this document. Therefore, in order to save
the Tribunal’s time I ask for permission to submit this complete
Document TC-75.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no further applications, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, you did not give a number to that
last affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: TC-75 will become Exhibit Number Ribbentrop-322.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, with the permission of the Tribunal,
I should like to deal with those points of my examination which
have not yet been dealt with.
<span class='pageno' title='406' id='Page_406'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all we are concerned with the witness who has been
allowed me by the Tribunal, Generaladmiral Böhm. The Tribunal
will recall that I was permitted to examine this witness at the end
of the presentation of evidence. In the meantime, after consultation
with Mr. Elwyn Jones and Sir David, I have obtained an affidavit
from Generaladmiral Böhm in Hamburg, so that I could perhaps
dispense with calling him as a witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I submitted this affidavit to Sir David and to Mr. Elwyn Jones
and Mr. Jones told me yesterday afternoon that Sir David agreed,
and that he would dispense with the cross-examination, and at the
same time I agreed not to insist on an examination, but to be
satisfied with the submitting and the reading of the affidavit.
I believe Sir David agrees.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to submit this affidavit of Generaladmiral Böhm’s
as Exhibit Number Raeder-129. This was sworn to on 13 June this
year in the presence of notary Dr. Sieveking at Hamburg.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: It is not necessary to read it now, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I should be very grateful if I
might be permitted to read this affidavit, as it deals with a portion
of evidence which is quite significant. The Tribunal will, I am sure,
recall the fact...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But I have already told you, Dr. Siemers—you
can certainly confine yourself to the really important part of
it and summarize anything that is really not so important. We
cannot have all these documents read out to us.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: The Tribunal will agree with me that as far as
my other documents are concerned, I read remarkably little. My
reason for wanting to read a part of it was because the British
Delegation, at the close of the cross-examination, submitted two
very lengthy summaries, GB-464 and GB-465. These are summaries
about the key documents of the 22d.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, surely you can tell us what the
subject matter of the affidavit is. We will then know the general
subject matter of it, and then I should have thought you could direct
your attention to the particular matters which are of special importance
here. It only takes up time if you are going to tell us what
the Prosecution have done.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I beg your pardon. Mr. President, if I have been
misunderstood. It was my intention to do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall not read from “I” of the affidavit. I shall only summarize
it. It is a discussion between Raeder and Generaladmiral Böhm in
the summer of 1939, on which occasion Böhm told Raeder that he
was worried about the political developments. He then asked Raeder
<span class='pageno' title='407' id='Page_407'></span>
whether he had called Hitler’s attention to the great dangers and to
the fact that the German Navy would not be in a position to carry
on a war at sea:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Grossadmiral Raeder replied to me”—and these are his
words—“that he had put this up to Hitler more than once,
and that he had concluded his exposition to Hitler with the
fundamental sentence: ‘In such a case the Navy could not do
anything but die gloriously.’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Number II of the affidavit of Generaladmiral Böhm:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“On 22 August 1939 Hitler made a speech to the top leaders of
the Armed Forces at the Obersalzberg. I was present during
the entire speech, which lasted 2 to 2½ hours. The speech was
delivered in Hitler’s office.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am omitting the next few points and continue:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The speech”—which was submitted to the Tribunal as Exhibit
Number Raeder-27—“has been set down by me with great
accuracy, and I can state under oath that the speech was
delivered in the way in which I have set it down. In particular
I can confirm that my account contains all the important
ideas and words.</p>

<p>“The versions submitted by the Prosecution, Documents Number
798-PS and 1014-PS, have been submitted to me by
Dr. Siemers. I have now compared my version with these
two versions.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I am again skipping a paragraph.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I declare under oath that some of the expressions used in
these documents were not used by Hitler at all, while others
were used by Hitler partly in another sense and partly in
another form.</p>

<p>“As to Document 798-PS, the following numbers of the pages
and lines agree with the version which I have just received,
and which was submitted by Sir David Maxwell-Fyfe.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to remind the Tribunal that this is the 10-page
summary, GB-464. In this version you will find the sentence:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“ ‘Afterward we shall discuss military details.’</p>

<p>“Comment: This sentence was not used. Military details did
not follow in 798-PS either.</p>

<p>“Page 1, Lines 7 to 10: ‘I made this decision already in the
spring, but I thought that first of all, in a few years’ time,
I should turn against the West, and only afterward against
the East.’</p>

<p>“Comment: The account as set down by me, on Page 1, Lines 5
to 8, is absolutely true. In any case Hitler never used the
words that he would first of all turn against the West.
<span class='pageno' title='408' id='Page_408'></span></p>

<p>“Page 1, Lines 12 to 14: ‘First of all I wanted to bring about
satisfactory relations with Poland so that I could first of all
fight against the West.’</p>

<p>“Comment: This sentence was never used, and what I have
just said applies here, too. Hitler never voiced the intention
that he wanted to fight against the West.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Now I shall omit the next point and on Lines 15 to 18 on Page 2
it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“ ‘It is easy for us to make decisions. We have nothing to lose,
only to gain. Our economic situation, due to our limited
resources, is such that we can hold out only a few more years.’</p>

<p>“Comment: As to the attitude taken here—the version in my
statement, Page 2, Lines 21 to 26, is absolutely correct. Above
all the sentence, ‘We have nothing...’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Siemers, does it not come to this? There
are two or three versions of this particular speech and this admiral
is saying that his version is correct. That is all it comes to. I mean,
he does not think the other versions are correct. Well, the Tribunal
will no doubt have to compare the three versions and compare it
with this affidavit. But what is the purpose or use of reading it to
us at this stage I do not know.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Very well, Mr. President. Thank you very much.
Then I ask that the Tribunal take judicial notice of the further
statements, as set out therein. I should like to refer only to the fact
that Generaladmiral Böhm expressly asserts and declares under oath
that the sentence which has been quoted several times: “I am afraid
that at the last moment some dirty dog will submit to me a plan
for mediation”——was not uttered by Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Referring to Document 1014-PS, I should like to read a sentence
which has been brought up by the Prosecution six or seven times:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The destruction of Poland is in the foreground and the aim
is the elimination of Polish vitality, not the reaching of a
certain line.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection Böhm says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“There was never any talk of destroying Poland or of
eliminating the vitality of the Polish people. What was
discussed was the breaking of the military forces.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And I should like the Tribunal to take judicial notice of these
very carefully set down statements for it seems to me that this is
important in assessing the evidence value of the documents presented
by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then under “III” Generaladmiral Böhm describes that period
during which he was commanding admiral in Norway. I should like
<span class='pageno' title='409' id='Page_409'></span>
the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this. This statement chiefly
concerns the struggle carried on by Raeder and Böhm against
Terboven, against the German civilian administration, and the
attempts to make peace with Norway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, after many weeks the interrogatory of Albrecht
has reached me in its final form. I sent it to the Translation Division
several days ago and have not yet received the translation. This
interrogatory has been approved and I put it in as Exhibit Number
Raeder-128. I ask the Tribunal to take judicial notice of this interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to mention that Generaladmiral Albrecht was for
many years one of Raeder’s closest co-workers. He resigned in
October 1939. He knows the attitude taken by Raeder and he knows
the High Command of the Navy before 1933 and up to 1938. He, too,
confirms the fact that Raeder constantly warned Hitler of complications,
and that Hitler always stated, “I have matters under control
and I will not let it come to war.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards all the other points, I ask, Mr. President, that the
Tribunal take judicial notice of these.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I should like to refer to the following: One interrogatory
by Generaladmiral Schulze has not yet come to hand. My efforts to
obtain this interrogatory date back to March 1946. I have given his
address. The witness is in retirement and lives in Hamburg-Blankenese.
Unfortunately until now the interrogatory has not
arrived in Hamburg. I should be very grateful to the Tribunal if it
would give me permission to submit this interrogatory at a later
date, as I myself have no means of expediting it. I do not know
when it will come in, as in the meantime it has been sent to
Washington for reasons I do not understand, but I certainly hope
that it will be returned at some future date. Finally, Mr. President...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Excuse me. What do you mean by it having
been sent to Washington? Did you say Washington?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I was informed by the General Secretary that
this interrogatory had been sent to Washington in order to locate
the witness there. But the witness resides in Hamburg-Blankenese.
I am sorry that I have no means of using my influence even though
I have been trying for 3 months.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, no doubt the General Secretary is
making every effort to have the witness found. If he is found,
then—what are the dates? You say that 3 months ago you submitted
this interrogatory? Was it sent to Hamburg or where was it sent?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I have...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Surely, Dr. Siemers, you ought to know. You
have been in touch all these 3 months with the General Secretary
<span class='pageno' title='410' id='Page_410'></span>
and you are stating that he sent it to Washington. You ought to
know. Have you given him any address in Hamburg? What is your
complaint?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, you have misunderstood. I was
not complaining. I was just stating the facts in order to show why
the interrogatory is not here, and I ask that when the interrogatory
arrives I may be permitted to submit it then, though by that time
the evidence...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I know you say that, but the Tribunal
wants to know where the interrogatory was first sent and why it
was sent to Washington, and why it was not sent to Hamburg and
what you know about the fact—the alleged fact—that the person
who was to make the interrogatory was at Hamburg?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I am from Hamburg myself and
last November I talked with the witness, and I gave his address
when I put in my first application to the General Secretary. Perhaps
some misunderstanding arose with the other offices which transmitted
the interrogatory. Perhaps they looked for a witness by the
name of Schulze in some other place. The name of the Generaladmiral
is Otto Schulze and it is quite possible that they looked up
someone else with this rather common name.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only answer I received was that the witness was being looked
for, to which I replied that it was not necessary to look for the
witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I think the Tribunal might be interested in knowing
that Dr. Siemers himself returned from Hamburg a few days ago,
and I think he has been there two or three times since he asked
for this interrogatory. Now, if he knows where this witness is, all
he had to do while he was up there was to go to a Military Government
officer, submit his questions, get them answered, and bring
them back; and I think it is a little bit unfair to blame the General
Secretary under these circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I regret very much that Mr. Dodd considers it
necessary to reproach me with unfairness. I was told that an interrogatory
could not be given to the witness by me. The interrogatory
for Admiral Albrecht I brought back with me from Hamburg at the
request of the General Secretary because the formula of the oath
had been omitted. In a case of this kind I consider it quite natural
that I should co-operate with the General Secretary. However, I
have submitted this interrogatory and I cannot understand how
Mr. Dodd could blame me if I have not brought the interrogatory
back with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, this seems to me a waste of time. We
had better get a report from the General Secretary.
<span class='pageno' title='411' id='Page_411'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I believe that I still have not been
understood. I am not accusing anyone. I am just asking for permission
to submit my interrogatory subsequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well. We will consider that. We will not
make any decision until we have heard a report from the General
Secretary upon the circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, then I should like to point out that
two of my applications were granted, which were not carried out
completely. One was the application concerning the files of the
British Admiralty containing the Allies’ plans regarding Scandinavia
and Finland. Purely as a matter of form I should like to say
that the answer from the Foreign Office, which is known to the
Tribunal, is available, and the Tribunal had approved the submission
of these files, but the request was turned down by the Foreign
Office. As this matter has not been dealt with before I should
like it to be made absolutely clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal, I think, has the communication
from the Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: But I did not submit it, Mr. President. Therefore,
I did not know under what number, what exhibit number it can be
found in the files of the Tribunal. Would it be possible, Mr. President...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You can give it a number, certainly. Give it
whatever number you think right. What is the number you want?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: May I submit this document as Exhibit Number
Raeder-130 either this afternoon or at the latest tomorrow morning?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Then, Mr. President, I made the request that the
first edition of Hitler’s book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span> be placed at my disposal.
In this case as well, I should like to point out that according to
information received the General Secretary has made every effort,
for which I am grateful, but he has not been successful in providing
me with this first edition.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to remind you of the fact that the edition used by
the Prosecution is from the year 1933 and therefore it cannot be
used as a basis for the argument put by the Prosecution concerning
the period before 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is a matter of argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Yes indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During my absence four documents were submitted by Sir David
Maxwell-Fyfe. As far as I was able to ascertain, these documents,
which all come from Admiral Assmann, were submitted with the
remark that Admiral Assmann belonged to the Staff of Grossadmiral
<span class='pageno' title='412' id='Page_412'></span>
Raeder. This fact was also mentioned several times in preceding
records.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the sake of order, I should like to clear up this error. Assmann
was in the historical section and he was in no way concerned
with the staff of Raeder. In this connection...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you got any evidence of the facts you
are stating, or do the Prosecution accept them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: We accept, I am sure. My Lord,
we have had it in evidence and we accept the fact that he was in
the Naval Historical Section of the German Admiralty. My Lord,
when I said “staff” I was speaking generally. I did not mean the
Operations Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then we need not waste further time about
that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I should like to refer to one point, Mr. President,
concerning these four documents: D-879, D-881, D-892, and D-854.
I hope that in this matter as well Sir David will agree with me.
All the English translations bear the heading “Diary”...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: My Lord, it is simply a point of
how the compilation of Admiral Assmann should be described. I am
quite prepared that it should be described as it is in the original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well...</p>

<p class='pindent'>SIR DAVID MAXWELL-FYFE: Dr. Siemers objected to its being
described as a “diary” and said that it should have been described
as an index. My Lord, I do not mind what it is described as.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What does it matter? Let us call it an index
then. Is that all your points?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, this is important insofar as here
in this courtroom many “Tagebücher” have been submitted under
the designation of a “diary,” and these were really entries made at
the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Sir David says that he will withdraw the
word “diary” and you may call it anything else you like. Really, it
is only a waste of our time to make this sort of technical point. Sir
David agrees with you, and he is prepared to withdraw the word
“diary.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well then, let us not say anything more
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I quite agree, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I do not wish to take up the time of the Tribunal
with all the other and very numerous errors in translation. My
final speech will show how important this point was in connection
<span class='pageno' title='413' id='Page_413'></span>
with the Assmann document. As suggested by the Tribunal I have
brought the other errors in translation to the notice of the General
Secretary only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If there are any errors in translation, that
matter can be taken up through the General Secretary with the
Translation Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Siemers, it is very improper for counsel in your position to
make statements of that sort for which you have no proof at all.
You know perfectly well that when there have been any alleged
mistranslations, the matter has always been referred through the
General Secretary to the Translation Division and then they have
been corrected; and for you to get up at this stage of the Trial and
say that there are many mistranslations, without any proof of it at
all, simply upon your own word, is a most improper thing for
counsel to do, and that is the view of the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: Mr. President, I beg to apologize, but I think I
probably did not express myself correctly. I am not making an
accusation, but with so many documents it is not surprising that
these errors did occur. I myself make mistakes. I am sorry if my
remarks should have been misunderstood.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Everybody makes mistakes, and everybody
is capable of having different opinions as to translations, but you
and every other member of the defendants’ counsel know that those
mistakes, if they are mistakes, will be corrected, if it is possible,
and they know the way that it can be done, and, therefore, as I said
before, it is very improper for you to get up and allege that there
are a lot of mistranslations. I do not want to hear anything more
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, have you any documents that you
wish to offer in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, with a letter dated 1 July 1946, I put
in three affidavits, after having submitted them previously to the
Prosecution. Those three documents will become Documents Keitel-23,
Keitel-24, and Keitel-25. I beg the Tribunal to receive them, since
the Prosecution, as Sir David has told me, does not object to their
being offered in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And they are at present being translated, or
have they been translated?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: They are in the process of being translated. I have
merely submitted the originals to the Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='414' id='Page_414'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well then, we will receive them in evidence
and consider them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Kauffmann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KURT KAUFFMANN (Counsel for Defendant Kaltenbrunner):
Mr. President, I have a few interrogatories which have
been granted to me by the Tribunal. I have the originals here with
me; they have been numbered, and I should like to submit them.
The Translation Division has informed me that the translations are
not yet at the disposal of the Tribunal, but I assume they will be
in the hands of the Tribunal in the next few days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I should like to state, in a few short sentences,
what the contents of the documents are, if the Tribunal
wishes me to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are three documents which refer to the same subject: The
testimony given by the President of the Red Cross at Geneva, Professor
Burckhardt; the testimony given by Dr. Bachmann, who was
the delegate of the Red Cross; and then there is Dr. Meyer’s testimony,
and he too was an official representative of the Red Cross.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these documents these witnesses deal with the discussions
during March and April 1945 which they had with the Defendant
Kaltenbrunner. They also show that agreements were reached on
the strength of these discussions which made it possible for thousands
of French, Belgian, and Dutch women and children to be
returned to their home countries. Prisoners of war were also
released under these agreements and internees from concentration
camps were allowed to return. Another result was that Kaltenbrunner
gave permission to visit the Jewish camp at Theresienstadt
and took pains that other camps received medical supplies, food,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All that is contained in detail in these three documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What numbers are you giving them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: The Professor Burckhardt document will be
Number Kaltenbrunner-3; Dr. Meyer and Dr. Bachmann, Numbers
Kaltenbrunner-4 and 5.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: A further document is the interrogatory
supplied by the former Gauleiter in Upper Austria, Eigruber. That
is Exhibit Number Kaltenbrunner-6. Here again I should like to
draw attention to one point. Among other things, this witness states
that the concentration camp at Mauthausen was not set up by Kaltenbrunner,
as has been alleged by the Prosecution and that he was
<span class='pageno' title='415' id='Page_415'></span>
not responsible for the life there or the presence of the internees
at the camp. That is stated here in detail and I do not propose to
read it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is the interrogatory of Freiherr von Eberstein,
which is Number Kaltenbrunner-7. Again, I shall not read
from it, but perhaps I may say, in just one sentence, that this witness
is testifying that he knows that the concentration camp at
Dachau and the two auxiliary camps belonging to Dachau were not,
as has been alleged by the Prosecution, to be exterminated during
the last months or weeks of the war, but that such a plan had been
contemplated exclusively by the Gauleiter of Munich, Giessler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is a further interrogatory, which is the testimony
of the witness Wanneck. That will be Exhibit Kaltenbrunner-8. I
should like to draw the attention of the Tribunal particularly to this
document. It is a lengthy document, and I shall not read from it.
However, I believe I can say that this man was particularly well
acquainted with the defendant and the whole of his official activities
in the course of many years. This witness held for years a
leading position in the Foreign Intelligence Service. He knows
Kaltenbrunner’s attitude regarding the executive and he confirms
the fact that Kaltenbrunner agreed with Himmler at the time, that
he, Himmler, would retain the executive powers while Kaltenbrunner
would work mostly in the sector of the Intelligence Service
as a whole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, Mr. President, there are two documents which have not
yet been discussed. Therefore, first of all, the Tribunal would have
to decide as to the relevancy of the documents, and as to whether
I shall be entitled to submit the documents. They are two short
letters which I have received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One is a letter from the mayor of the town of Dachau, dated 4 April
1946. The Tribunal may possibly remember that during the taking
of evidence by the Prosecution it was frequently mentioned that the
population in the vicinity had knowledge of the abuses. This man,
who has now been instated by the American authorities, confirms
his own experiences. In my opinion they do not bear out the thesis
of the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Immediately connected with this is the second letter, which is
from the well-known Pastor Niemöller, and which is dated 17 April
1946. Niemöller had spent some time in Dachau.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, would it not be best if we were heard
on the first affidavit before the Niemöller affidavit is taken up?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We have objected to this affidavit by the mayor of Dachau for
the reason that it is simply a letter. We have had no opportunity
to file any cross-questions or to ask any questions of the man at all.
<span class='pageno' title='416' id='Page_416'></span>
These letters come in here. If we are going to submit all the letters
that come in—we have bales of them, actually.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We do not like to object on purely technical grounds, if there is
anything here that would really be helpful to the Tribunal. On the
other hand, we do not feel that we should deny ourselves the opportunity
to make clear the entire story by cross-questions of some kind.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is with reference to Schwalber?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, Sir.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: I did not quite understand what you said,
Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What Mr. Dodd said was that they objected to
this document from Schwalber because they have not had any opportunity
to put any questions to him, either by way of having him
called as a witness or by a cross-interrogatory. Therefore, they
object to the introduction of the document in its present form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Yes, I understand. I know this is somewhat
problematical, but the Tribunal will be able to assess the evidence
value of the letters according to their own opinion. Perhaps I may
submit these two short documents to the Tribunal. So far as I know,
the Prosecution is acquainted with these two documents, because
they have been in the Translation Division, and some time ago a
representative of the Prosecution told me that very probably objections
would be raised. That was why, at the beginning, I told the
Tribunal it would first have to decide as to the relevancy of the
documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, Dr. Kauffmann, the best way will be
for the Tribunal to read the document and to consider it. We will
do that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. KAUFFMANN: Very well, Mr. President. Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I should also like to indicate to the Tribunal that we
take the same position with respect to the Niemöller letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You consider them both, then? You are objecting
also to the Niemöller letter?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Yes, on the same grounds.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. OTTO PANNENBECKER (Counsel for Defendant Frick):
Mr. President, the reply to the Messersmith interrogatory has not
yet been submitted. The reply has been received in the meantime,
and has been translated, too. I believe, however, that the Tribunal
has probably not yet received it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you offer it in evidence and give it a
number?
<span class='pageno' title='417' id='Page_417'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes, Sir; I was going to. But I did not
expect that it would come up today, and I have not the number
which I shall give to the exhibit. May I be permitted to furnish the
number later? Yes—I have it here, Mr. President, and I shall now
submit it as Exhibit Number Frick-14. This is the reply to an interrogatory.
The replies are in the same form as those which Mr. Messersmith
gave in the interrogatories concerning other defendants. I
shall refer to this interrogatory in detail during my final speech.
Therefore I need not read it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is still one reply outstanding in an interrogatory of
Konrad, and I beg to be permitted to submit it as soon as I receive it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That has been granted, has it? And it is now
before the witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. PANNENBECKER: Thank you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Servatius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ROBERT SERVATIUS (Counsel for Defendant Sauckel):
Mr. President, several interrogatories have still to be submitted.
First of all, I submit Exhibit Number Sauckel-15 to the Tribunal.
That is a Darré interrogatory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Whose interrogatory was that? Whose interrogatory?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Darré, the Minister for Food and Agriculture.
This interrogatory deals with matters which have in part already
come up at this Trial. I should like to draw your attention to a few
points. There is the question of what was Sauckel’s general attitude,
particularly toward Himmler’s views; and the witness stresses the
fact there was considerable controversy between Himmler and
Sauckel in this respect. He mentions one particular instance which
he himself witnessed. He speaks about a factory in Thuringia which
was directly under Sauckel’s control and says that the workers there
were so free that they hired themselves out to farmers during the
day, which was rather too much of a good thing. He then talked
about a clash between Sauckel and Himmler in the presence of the
Führer about the question of treatment, and he says that Himmler
stated, “I am subordinate to the Führer only, and for my official
business I am under the Reich Marshal; and I do not have to justify
myself to you.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is an interrogatory from Minister of Labor Seldte,
which has been allowed by the Tribunal and which I shall submit
as Exhibit Number Sauckel-16. I should like to bring out just a
few points. The witness talks about Sauckel’s functions and the
<span class='pageno' title='418' id='Page_418'></span>
functions of Dr. Ley, and he says that Sauckel carried out the
functions of the state while Ley looked after the social welfare
and social supervision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then he goes on to talk about inspections and control, and he
says that the offices for accident insurance, health, and factory
inspection were in existence before and had continued to function
under the responsibility of the Ministry of Labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then comes the interrogatory of Dr. Voss, which I submit as
Exhibit Number Sauckel-17. I shall submit the original later. I
am afraid I cannot find it at the moment. This doctor was medical
officer in a camp, and he speaks of the conditions in the camps,
particularly after air attacks, and about the activities and care of
the Labor Front. He not only deals with the camps in which he
was working but he knows a great deal generally about conditions
in other camps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His statement is in contradiction to the testimony given by
Dr. Jäger. In the same way the following document, which I shall
submit as Exhibit Number Sauckel-18 and which comes from
Dr. Ludwig Scharmann, although dealing with another sector, contains
similar statements, too, which are also in direct contrast to
the testimony given by Dr. Jäger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That completes the interrogatories which have been granted me.
Now I have still another number of documents for which I have
applied, but on which a decision has not yet been given. I do not
know whether I should now submit them to the Tribunal. They
are mostly concerned with laws and decrees and I would like to
submit them in addition to what I have already submitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, Dr. Servatius, the Tribunal would like
you to submit them now, because the Tribunal wishes to deal with
the evidence on behalf of the Defense finally, now and today.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: There is a decree by Sauckel dealing with the
return of sick foreign workers to their homes. It shows that workers
who had fallen sick were sent back and that Red Cross employees
had to accompany them. The actual decree is in the official collection
of laws and decrees which has already been submitted. I
shall ascertain my exhibit number presently. It will be Number
Sauckel-99 in the supplementary document book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is Document Number Sauckel-100, which comes from
the <span class='it'>Reichsarbeitsblatt</span>, 1943, which has already been offered in
evidence, too. This deals with the investigation of sanitary measures
in camps, and it concerns the accusations which have been
made with reference to these accommodation problems.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is Document Number Sauckel-101 which is a memorandum
for French prisoners of war on leave regarding their
<span class='pageno' title='419' id='Page_419'></span>
improved status under the so-called “transformation.” I shall submit
it and give the exhibit a number. For the moment it is
Document Number Sauckel-101.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then come Documents 102 and 103. Both are laws contained
in the official <span class='it'>Reichsgesetzblatt</span>. They are “German Instructions
Regarding Compulsory Labor Service.” It is the Emergency Services
Order which I submit as Document Number Sauckel-102. Then there
is the Compulsory Labor Decree which will be Document Number
Sauckel-103, in the supplement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I find that Document 4006-PS contains a number of important
regulations, but I am told that the Prosecution is going to
read them, and therefore I assume that I need not do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I have received an affidavit from Count Spreti, who, from
the beginning of the Eastern campaign, was active as a recruiting
officer in the East. It deals with conditions, and it states particularly
that Sauckel’s activity had brought about a basic change in
the general attitude. It is short and I consider that it is of particular
importance, because up to now no recruiting officer has been heard
on the subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then I was proposing to submit Document Number Sauckel-109,
which will be a list...</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, with regard to that affidavit I
am told, the Prosecution having not seen it at all, that that should
be accepted with the same reservations as have been made in the
previous cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly. Was that affidavit you spoke
of by Count von Spreti, S-p-r-e-t-i?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Then I was going to submit a list of all of
Sauckel’s decrees as Document Number Sauckel-109 which will
give an idea of the great care he took of all kinds of matters.
This list will give the titles only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, you did not give a number to
the affidavit of Count von Spreti.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: It will be given Number Sauckel-108 in my
document book and then I shall give it an exhibit number later
when I submit the numbers for the other documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then as Document Number Sauckel-110, 111, and 112...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Servatius, are you not giving us exhibit
numbers now?
<span class='pageno' title='420' id='Page_420'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I cannot do so at the moment because I have
not got the originals with me and part of these are official records
which have been submitted already.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But you see in the case of the Defendant
Sauckel, as in the case of every other defendant, the exhibits put
in on his behalf, the exhibits offered in evidence on his behalf
should have a consecutive series of numbers and that is a consecutive
series which is settled by the counsel himself who offers
the documents in evidence. It does not depend upon whether he
has the original before him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: In that case I can give them exhibit numbers.
Document Number-108 will be Exhibit Number Sauckel-18.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Which is that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Exhibit Number 18.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps the most convenient way would be
if you would carefully go through your exhibits and give the list
to the General Secretary, giving the exact exhibit number of each
document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then Documents Number 110, 111, and 112, contained in the
supplement, are three laws which deal with the position of the Reich
Defense Commissioner who was mentioned in connection with the
allocation of labor. The Reich Defense Commissioner is, of course,
the Gauleiter who was mentioned during the case of Speer in connection
with the armament industry. These are merely the basic
laws, so as to have them at hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the case of Speer had been heard, I received an affidavit
from the witnesses Hildebrandt and Stothfang, who had been
examined here in Court. It deals with the question of how far
Sauckel had to obey Speer’s instructions and what the relations
were between the two offices. The Prosecution have not yet defined
their attitude and I think perhaps it would be best if...</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: We will be glad to have this affidavit submitted,
Mr. President. We have no objection whatever to it. As a matter
of fact, if it was not submitted by Dr. Servatius, we intended to
offer it ourselves.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well. Of course the Tribunal thinks
it is irregular, really, that a witness who has been called and has
given evidence, has been cross-examined—has been re-examined
and cross-examined by any other counsel for the defense who
want to—that he should be entitled to give any other evidence,
but if you are both agreed that it is convenient in this case, as a
special circumstance, we will admit it.
<span class='pageno' title='421' id='Page_421'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I think—Mr. President, I, of course, recognize at
once the Court’s observation about submitting affidavits of witnesses
who have been before the Tribunal. What happened here was
that some rather material matters were not gone into when he
was here, and I think the Tribunal will find them quite helpful
in clearing up the situation about Sauckel and Speer with respect
to their relative and individual responsibilities for this slave labor
program. Other than that, I, of course, would not urge it at all.
I think the Court will find it helpful.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HANS FLÄCHSNER (Counsel for Defendant Speer): Mr. President,
I would not make a formal objection against the admission
of such an affidavit if I were not convinced, in this particular case,
that with the admission of such an affidavit a series of questions
will be opened up which will, in turn, necessitate further arguments.
I saw the wording of this affidavit only this morning and
I am convinced that at least further investigation of its contents
will be necessary. I believe, therefore, that if this Trial is to be
shortened, in the case before us as well, one ought not to depart
from the general rule that affidavits from witnesses who have
already appeared before the Tribunal should not be permitted. In
this particular case, where there are references to the publication
with which the affidavit deals, the case could be made quite
clear if these publications were submitted and, therefore, the affidavit
is not at all necessary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you wish to say anything in answer to
that objection?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Mr. President, this affidavit is, in fact, a
supplementation of the instructions contained in Document 4006,
which the Prosecution is proposing to submit; but I did not know
that this was proposed. What we are actually concerned with here
is a question which was opened up by Speer’s examination, namely,
the significance of Speer’s Ministry as compared to Sauckel’s office:
Who, of the two, was the more powerful? Who could give orders?
Who had to obey? I think the documents will make that clear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but you and the Prosecution had the
opportunity of cross-examining Speer when he was in the witness
box and you could then have elucidated anything you wanted to
elucidate at that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Yes, only the circumstances were not known
to me at that moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Mr. President, I do not wish to press this at all,
and if the Tribunal has any doubt about it at all I will withdraw
my position. I thought it might be helpful, but it really is not
important and if there is any question I think it is better we let it go.
<span class='pageno' title='422' id='Page_422'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal think it is irregular to
introduce new evidence by affidavits from a person who has already
been called as a witness, and in view of the objection on behalf
of the Defendant Speer, they cannot accept the evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: In that case, I will withdraw it. That completes
my statement of evidence. The only thing that is still outstanding
is the witness Letsch’s interrogatory, which has been
granted, and the interrogatory of the witness Bichenbach. I have
no hope of still receiving them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Steinbauer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. GUSTAV STEINBAUER (Counsel for Defendant Seyss-Inquart):
Mr. President, I have four documents which I beg to
submit and which I have received through the General Secretary.
The Tribunal has allowed them and the Prosecution know of them.
Unfortunately, however, the translations have not yet been completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first document contains questions and answers from
Director Dirk Hannema, director of the Bovymans Museum in
Rotterdam, about the alleged plundering of art treasures. I shall
give this document the Number Seyss-Inquart-108. I shall submit
the English text and the Dutch original.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document is an edition of the newspaper <span class='it'>Nieuwe
Rotterdamsche Courant</span>, dated 17 May 1942, of which I have the
original and a German translation. It contains a warning regarding
the shooting of hostages. This document I shall submit in the
original under Document Number Seyss-Inquart-109.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following document is also an edition of the same newspaper;
it is dated 10 August 1942, and it also contains an announcement
regarding the shooting of hostages. In connection with this
document I should like to draw your attention to the fact that
this announcement was the result of an order from the Military
Commander in Holland, General Christiansen, and that the Senior
SS and Police Leader, Rauter, signed it. I shall give it Document
Number Seyss-Inquart-110.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document I received only yesterday from the General
Secretariat, and it is a copy of the interrogatory of General of the
Cavalry Von Kleffel. From 27 March 1945 until 8 April 1945, he
was Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the 25th Army in Holland.
He confirms that Reich Commissioner Seyss-Inquart, in a letter to
the Führer, had requested that the fighting should cease, in order
to save the country from being heavily damaged and also to prevent
a famine. This document is Number Seyss-Inquart-111 in my
document book. This document had been allowed by the Tribunal.
I beg, therefore, that it be received in evidence.
<span class='pageno' title='423' id='Page_423'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Today the General Secretary’s office sent me two affidavits. One
comes from the former commander of the Defense District of
Scheveningen. His name is Erwin Tschoppe. He is submitting an
affidavit dealing with the attitude and conduct of the defendant
with respect to the evacuation of the coastal area. Because of
the short time at my disposal, I have not yet been able to hand
this document and the following one to the Prosecution, but I have
already informed the Prosecution that these two documents exist.
The second document is also...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Steinbauer, these documents, I apprehend,
have not been shown to the Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: No.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait a minute; they have not been approved
by the Tribunal and one question that arises is: Are they very
long? Because I find that the Translation Division is being overloaded
with very long documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: No, it is a short document, but it appears
to me to be important, because it shows how the defendant acted
during that difficult situation and how he took care of the Dutch
population.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If it is short and if you will submit it to
the Prosecution, then it can be translated and admitted subject
to any objection.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes, Sir. The same applies to the following
document which I also received today. It is an affidavit of Adalbert
Joppich. He was President of the German Supreme Court in the
Netherlands, and he makes a very brief statement about the position
and the attitude of the defendant with regard to legal questions
affecting the Dutch civilian population. I beg that this document
should also be admitted in evidence and that I may use the same
procedure of submitting a copy of the translation to the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What number did you give?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: The Tschoppe document will be Document
Number Seyss-Inquart-112 and the Adalbert Joppich document will
be Document Number Seyss-Inquart-113. Documents allowed by
the Tribunal and still outstanding are affidavits by Bolle, Dr. Reuter,
Völkers, and Lindhorst-Homan. The General Secretariat and I
are trying to obtain these affidavits. So far it has only been possible
to ascertain Bolle’s address. Finally, I request that two applications
which I have made in writing should be granted; one concerns
the obtaining of the defendant’s NSDAP membership card which
was impounded when he was arrested, and which must be among
his personal documents in the custody of the Tribunal. A few
<span class='pageno' title='424' id='Page_424'></span>
months ago I made a request to that effect, but both sides apparently
lost sight of the matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Of course, you do not mean that it is in
the custody of the Tribunal; you may mean that it is in the custody
of the military authorities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes. I meant the prison administration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, no doubt, they can reproduce it. What
was the other document?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Well, Mr. President, then in the cross-examination...</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I do not want to take up Your
Lordship’s time, but that membership card, that could have been
applied for months ago. It is on the same footing as these documents
which counsel has been putting in. We have not seen them.
I do not know what this card is going to prove, but it is going
to be a great deal of trouble to get it here, just as these documents
are giving a great deal of work to the Translation Division.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What is the importance of the membership
card? Presumably he knows when he became a member. What
relevance does the card have to this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: It is of importance because according to the
war crime law which has now been published in Austria, all members
having a membership number above 6,500,000 will not be
regarded as so-called “old fighters” or illegals. Seyss-Inquart has
stated in the witness box...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That has nothing to do with the Tribunal.
It may be relevant in some other proceeding and before some
other court but not before this Court.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Only insofar as the Prosecution had alleged
that he had been a member of the NSDAP since 1931. But, of
course, I am not trying to make difficulties. I only thought that
the membership card might be among the belongings which were
taken away from the prisoner and that one could have a look at it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. But did he deny that he was a member
since 1931?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes, oh, yes. He states that he did not
become a member until 13 March 1938—formally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Oh, yes, formally; I remember, yes. But
he had been a member of the Austrian Nazi Party very much
longer, if I remember rightly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: We will agree here and now, Mr. President, that
that card would show that he became a member, as far as the card
<span class='pageno' title='425' id='Page_425'></span>
is concerned, on that date. I am sure that is what it will show and
if it will help the doctor, we will be glad to agree to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: The last document for which I am applying
is the following: During cross-examination a document was submitted
in which an 18 year-old female police clerk named Hildegard
Kunze confirms that my client caused Dutch Jews to be
sterilized. Seyss-Inquart maintains that he has never written to
the Police directly, but that in three personal letters addressed
directly to Himmler, he did object to the treatment of Jews,
and that in one of his letters he mentioned sterilization. This,
presumably, was the reason why the witness mentioned it and
probably she gained knowledge of these facts because Himmler
sent the original or copy of the letters to the Main Security Office.
In connection with this important matter my client has requested
me to make an attempt to have these letters which he wrote to
Himmler produced in order to disprove the incriminating statement
made by the witness Hildegard Kunze. I do not conceal the
fact that it will probably be difficult to find these letters among
the very many documents of the Main Security Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you made your application in writing
about this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes, I have made a written application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Giving the dates when the letters were
written?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Yes, everything I could ascertain regarding
the dates and the addresses is contained in my application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal will consider that, but
you understand that the work involved in this sort of thing is
very great indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STEINBAUER: Mr. President, far be it from me to underestimate
the difficulties which are connected with my application.
Apart from this, I have no further application to make.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='426' id='Page_426'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will not sit in open session
Saturday next, nor will it sit in open session on any Saturday in the
future unless it gives notice that it is going to do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yes, Dr. Thoma?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Mr. President, yesterday I mentioned an affidavit
of Dr. Heinz Oeppert, Reichshauptstellenleiter. I have now received
this affidavit, and I have also already conferred with Mr. Dodd
about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I now beg the permission of the High Tribunal to submit this
affidavit. Mr. Dodd has no objections to the submission of this
affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I read a very brief passage from this affidavit, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Can you tell us what the affidavit is about?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Yes, Mr. President. This Dr. Oeppert had the Office
of Ideological Enlightenment in the office of the Führer’s deputy for
the supervision of the entire ideological and intellectual framing of
the Party. Concerning this activity and this office he testified that
it involved almost exclusively a reporting and registration of events
in this sphere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any active interference in the church policy of the State or the
Party would not have been possible even if they had wished it, for
this office had no executive facilities of any kind. There were
constantly very intense differences with the State and Party
organizations which participated in this sphere of activity, that is,
between the Propaganda Ministry and the Church and the SD and
Party Chancellery. The suppression of certain ideological groups
and sects as well as the measures taken against individual clergymen,
as far as I know, were taken by the SD or the Gestapo
without the knowledge or authority of this office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am asking the High Tribunal to take judicial notice of this
document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. THOMA: Exhibit Number Rosenberg-51.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Fritz. On behalf of Fritzsche—is anyone
representing Dr. Fritz?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. ALFRED SCHILF (Counsel for Defendant Fritzsche): Dr.
Schilf for Dr. Fritz, who is absent, representing the Defendant
Fritzsche.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, Dr. Fritz applied in writing last Monday concerning
two affidavits which are still outstanding, one an affidavit
<span class='pageno' title='427' id='Page_427'></span>
by the journalist—the English journalist, Clifton Delmar—and the
other an affidavit by His Excellency Feldscher, then Minister of the
protective power in Berlin, now in Berne. Neither of these affidavits
has arrived yet, and we are asking the High Tribunal if we may
submit and be allowed these documents later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have no further comments. No other applications have been
made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have you—I did not hear the name of the
second one. Was it Feldscher?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: Excellency Feldscher, Minister of the protective
power. He is now at Berne in Switzerland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have these affidavits been placed before the
Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: No, Mr. President, they are not yet available. They
have not arrived yet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see. Are they affidavits or interrogatories?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: They are two interrogatories, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Interrogatories, I see. Well then, when the
interrogatories come back answered, they can be shown to the
Prosecution if they want to put in cross-interrogatories; and then
they can be translated and submitted to the Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Schilf, there was an application—I am not sure whether it
was in writing or whether it was only oral—with reference to
Schörner and Voss, and one other man, whose statements were used
in cross-examination by the Prosecution. I think they were affidavits,
I am not sure; and there was an oral application, I think, to
cross-examine those persons. Do you want that to be done, or have
you withdrawn that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: Mr. President, that application has not been withdrawn,
but it was put in only as an auxiliary application, to have
effect only if the interrogation notes submitted by the Russian
Prosecution—it seems to me that these interrogation notes cannot be
considered as affidavits, but only interrogation records of a police
character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And Dr. Fritz made application to the effect that if these three
documents were to be used as documents of evidence, we cannot
waive the cross-examination. These three documents were used in
the examination of the Defendant Fritzsche only in part, and only
short passages were submitted to the defendant in his examination.
Every detail there he has...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What you were saying is that in case the
Prosecution do not want to use the whole of these documents, but
<span class='pageno' title='428' id='Page_428'></span>
only the parts which were put to the Defendant Fritzsche in the
course of cross-examination, then you do not need to have those
persons, Voss and Schörner, called for cross-examination; but if the
Prosecution wish to put in the whole document, then you want to
cross-examine them. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: Mr. President, that is correct.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are you meaning that you are asking the
Tribunal to strike out the passages in the Defendant Fritzsche’s
evidence which deal with these statements or are you merely
meaning that if the Prosecution wish to use, not only the parts
which they have put to the defendant in cross-examination but other
parts of the document, that in that event you would like to cross-examine
the deponents Voss and Schörner?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: Mr. President, we only want the cross-examination
to take place in case the Court should regard the three interrogation
records, as a whole, as documentary evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, then you do mean what I first of all put
to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, perhaps the Prosecution, General Rudenko, would tell us
whether he is wanting to put in the whole document or whether he
has put enough of it in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>GEN. RUDENKO: Mr. President, as I have already stated to the
Tribunal, when these written statements were submitted, the
records of the interrogations were written down in agreement with
the rules of procedure which is in existence in the Soviet Union. The
Prosecution will only use those parts which were read here before
the Tribunal and on which the Defendant Fritzsche was cross-examined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, then it is not necessary to have
those witnesses brought here for cross-examination. Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SCHILF: Yes, indeed, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Then that brings the Tribunal to the end of
the evidence for the Defense, with the exception of two witnesses
who are to be—who are here and to be called on behalf of the
Defendant Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. FLÄCHSNER: Mr. President, on behalf of the Defendant
Speer may I submit in addition a document which has already been
translated and is known to the Prosecution. This is the Führer
protocol of 3 January 1943. This shall have the Document Number
Speer-35. I had already listed it as Exhibit Number 35 in the index
of the documents submitted by me which I gave the Court. Only
at that time it had not yet been translated. I should like to submit
it now.
<span class='pageno' title='429' id='Page_429'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What I wanted to say was that that concludes the whole of the
evidence on behalf of the defendants with the exception of interrogatories
which have already been granted, the answers to which
have not yet been received. Of course, those interrogatories, subject
to their being admissible, will be admitted when the answers are
received and that applies also to anything in the shape of an affidavit
which has been allowed by the Tribunal; but otherwise the
evidence for the defendants is now closed with the exception of
Dr. Bergold.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Mr. President, I have another question regarding
the appearance for testimony of the witness Walkenhorst. In
case he is not called as a witness, I have an affidavit at my disposal,
which I have received; and I assume that I may submit this in case
this witness is not examined here before the Court. It deals with a
very brief question, namely, the telephone conversation which
Sauckel had regarding the evacuation of the Buchenwald Concentration
Camp. Walkenhorst happened to be the man at the other
end of the wire. I have an affidavit on this one question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, if the witness is being questioned here in Court I shall
ask him; but in case he is not examined I request that this be
held open.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are speaking of Walkenhorst?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Yes, the witness Walkenhorst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, he is just going to be examined now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I hope so, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But—I believe he is here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have before me a list of supplementary applications but I think
that they have all been dealt with in the discussion which we have
had during the last 2 days. And if there is any other matter which
the defendants’ counsel wish to raise they should raise it now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well then, I take it then, that as I said, the evidence for the
Defense is now concluded, subject to the reception of documents
which I may describe as outstanding, either interrogatories or
affidavits.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Mr. President, may I be permitted, please, to introduce
three more documents with the permission of the Tribunal.
They concern the following questions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>When considering what influence the paper published by Streicher
exercised on the German population, it is of decisive importance to
know how the circulation of this paper developed and to what
circumstances the fact is to be attributed that, within a certain
period of time, there was a marked increase in its circulation.
<span class='pageno' title='430' id='Page_430'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I set myself the task of determining from the mastheads of the
weekly paper, <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>, how its circulation developed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: But—we have already dealt with this application.
We have had the application before us and we have considered
it and we have refused it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, I beg your pardon, Mr. President; it concerns
the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite by accident, when looking at various issues of this newspaper,
I ascertained that in the year 1935 a marked jump in circulation
took place and the Defense would like to prove that this
increase is not to be traced to an increased demand by the German
people but rather to the fact that high Party offices exercised their
influence and, together with a new publishing management, brought
about a threefold increase. Naturally, it is of essential significance
whether a threefold increase results from a demand by the people
or whether, as in this case, the German Labor Front intervened in
the person of Dr. Ley, and a special publicity number was published,
which was then circulated by Dr. Ley’s efforts and by using the huge
machinery of the German Labor Front.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is something I want to prove and I am of the opinion that
it is of importance to the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have three documents along these lines, Mr. President; and
with the permission of the Tribunal I shall read a directive, and
I ask that I be allowed to introduce it as evidence. From this it
appears that Dr. Ley as the leader of the German Labor Front, gave
the order to all the offices of the German Labor Front to circulate
this special edition and to see to it that it was widely circulated in
the factories, and so forth. For, indeed, it is one of the essential
points of the Indictment that the German people were influenced
against the Jews by <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span> and by the Defendant Streicher,
and thereby later made ripe to support the measures in the East,
even to the extent of mass extermination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, I ask that this evidence be admitted and that it be
declared relevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You said you have got three documents. The
first one is a directive from Ley?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Yes, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes. What are the other two?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: One is an excerpt from the newspaper <span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>
in May 1935, Number 18, which reads as follows:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Bernhardt, who fled from Berlin to France, writes in the
<span class='it'>Pariser Tageblatt</span> (Paris, 29 March 1935) under the heading,
<span class='it'>‘Stürmer</span> Circulation Increases Threefold,’ as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='431' id='Page_431'></span></p>

<p>“ ‘The support which the pornographer Streicher received
from the highest offices of the Reich in circulating his <span class='it'>Stürmer</span>
helped him to triple his circulation within less than a
year...’ ”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Wait. You have already told us that the
circulation of the Stürmer went up threefold. It is not necessary to
repeat it all again. We only want to know what the documents are.
The first one is a directive of Ley. The second one is an issue of
<span class='it'>Der Stürmer</span>. What is the third one?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: And the third—the third is a summary of the circulation
from January 1935 until the middle of October 1935; and
from this it appears that, within the period of 1 year, the circulation
increased from 113,800 to 486,000. Anybody will probably...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, that is quite sufficient. We do not want
to know any more about it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: Very well, Mr. President. Then, may I be permitted...</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I—it is entirely in the hands of
the Tribunal, but we should see no objection from the Prosecution’s
point of view to admitting these documents. The first would appear
to directly link the Defendant Streicher with another of the conspirators.
It would be a most important document.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well, Dr. Marx. Then the three documents
will be admitted.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I should like to submit the documents under Exhibit
Numbers 19, 20, and 21.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. MARX: I beg your pardon, Mr. President. May I make one
more remark? Why the matter came about now and was so delayed
is that I personally did not know anything about it before. It was
only by accident that I learned this from <span class='it'>Der Stürmer’s</span> masthead.
It was previously unknown to me, and I considered it—considered
it from my point of view as pertinent evidence. I ask to be excused
for not submitting it before now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, I naturally do not wish to submit
any further evidence; but I should like to ask you to clarify a
question, a question of law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this time interrogations are going on constantly in the commissions
in order to gather evidence with regard to the organizations.
Witnesses are being interrogated there whom we here do not
know, and documents are being submitted which we have not yet
seen. It will be several weeks before we know the results of this
evidence about the organizations.
<span class='pageno' title='432' id='Page_432'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we defense attorneys, who are working here, are thinking
of the following case: It could happen, for instance, that one of these
defendants could be incriminated by some new testimony about the
organizations, or that documents might be submitted which we, as
Defense Counsel for these defendants, would absolutely have to take
into consideration in our pleas, or to which we would have to offer
evidence in rebuttal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we are agreed that the evidence here should be concluded,
but we would naturally like to reserve the right in such cases to
learn the results of the hearings for the organizations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you will find, when you look carefully
at the order which the Tribunal made, that this matter was provided
for and that, if there is any matter in the course of the hearing of
the case against the organizations which in any way materially or
directly affects any of the individual defendants, the Tribunal, of
course, has discretion to hear counsel for that defendant upon the
matter; and I think that is specifically dealt with in the order that
we have made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: This order is known to us, of course, Mr. President;
but we just wanted to be clear on this point, that this order
will still remain in force, even if the presentation of evidence here
is concluded.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Do the Prosecution wish to make any application to the Tribunal?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I have eight documents to put in. My Lord,
they are documents which it is intended to refer to in the final
speech; and accordingly I would not propose to do more than just to
indicate their nature to the Tribunal and put them in very quickly.
I have a list of them which I will hand up first.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Are they documents which have not yet been
offered in evidence? It may be convenient to see their nature.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, My Lord; I am offering them in
rebuttal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You have a list here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: Yes, My Lord, the first document is...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Have they been communicated to the defendants’
counsel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: No, My Lord; I have copies here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first document, 1519-PS, contains orders for the treatment of
Soviet prisoners of war. My Lord, that is not strictly offered in
rebuttal; but the Tribunal has had before it a document, EC-338,
which was put in as Exhibit USSR-356. That document consisted of
<span class='pageno' title='433' id='Page_433'></span>
a commentary by Admiral Canaris on these orders, and Your Lordship
may remember the document. Defendant Keitel had made
certain notes on it on which he was cross-examined, the reference
in the shorthand notes being Pages 7219 to 7223 (Volume X, Pages
622-625). My Lord, it seems appropriate that the actual orders
should be before the Court and not merely the commentary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that will be GB-525, and the Tribunal will see it
consists of a covering letter from the Defendant Bormann to Gauleiter
and Kreisleiter covering the OKW letter signed by General
Reinecke, the head of the Prisoners of War Organization; and then
there follow the actual regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Has not this been in before?</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, I am told not. What was put in
was the commentary on this document, which was by Admiral
Canaris. It was included—this document was included in the Keitel
document book, but it was not formally put in.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I see. You mean it will be GB...</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: 525, My Lord.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, the second document, D-912, will
be GB-526. This is a series of broadcasts from German stations
between 6 September and 22 October 1939, monitored by the British
Broadcasting Corporation and dealing with the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I offer that document in view of the Defendant Raeder’s
evidence. The Tribunal will remember that, according to him, the
article on the 23 October in the <span class='it'>Völkischer Beobachter</span> came as a
complete surprise. The reference in the shorthand notes is 9832,
Page 9832 (Volume XIV, Page 80).</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, it also arises out of the question, I think, put to the
Tribunal—put by the Tribunal to the Defendant Fritzsche; and it
confirms his evidence that broadcasts blaming Mr. Winston Churchill
for being responsible for the sinking of the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> started at the
early part of September and went right on through the month.
Actually, these broadcasts, the Tribunal will see—the first on 6 September.
I might read perhaps one sentence in the second line:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The German press refutes the accusations of the British
press that the German submarine had sunk the <span class='it'>Athenia</span>.
Churchill, as one of his first actions, ordered the <span class='it'>Athenia</span> to
be sunk in order to stir up anti-German feeling in the U.S.A.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Well, then there are similar broadcasts from other stations on
that day, again on the 7th, the 11th, the 25th. I have not got the
one on the 27th, put in by General Rudenko; but there is one by the
Defendant Fritzsche on 1 October, and so on, culminating with a
<span class='pageno' title='434' id='Page_434'></span>
broadcast by Goebbels on the 22d, the day before the article
appeared. My Lord, that will be GB-526.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next document, 3881-PS, is an extract from the proceedings
before the Peoples’ Court on 7 and 8 August 1944, when seven
defendants were tried for the attempt on Hitler’s life. My Lord,
I am only putting in a translated extract, but the photostat is in fact
complete. I should have said that what is before the Tribunal is
only a translation of certain extracts, but the exhibit contains the
complete record of the proceedings. My Lord, I...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Unless we have it translated, we shall not be
able to have it in evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, we do not intend to refer to more
than the translated extracts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: I only said that for the benefit of Defense
Counsel, who may wish to look elsewhere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I put that in in view of the Defendant Jodl’s evidence
that it was only because British generals obeyed orders that the
German generals were now being tried. That is Page 11043 of the
shorthand notes (Volume XV, Page 383). And the passages—the
nature of the passages is that the president of the Peoples’ Court is
refusing to accept the defense of superior orders put forward by the
defendants. My Lord, that will be GB-527.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document is D-181, which I offer as Exhibit
GB-528. It is a letter by a Gauleiter to Gauamtsleiter, Gauinspektor,
and Kreisleiter on the subject of the law of hereditary health and
sterilization on the ground of imbecility. It is an important document
in connection with the Defendant Frick, and I put it in in view
of the statements made on his behalf by his counsel at Page 8296
(Volume XII, Page 162) of the shorthand notes, My Lord, when he
said in effect that Frick had no control over the political police and
that Himmler’s subordination to him was purely nominal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, there are a number of references in the letter to the
fact that the decree—and indeed its administration—was the responsibility
of the Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document is of a similar nature, and I attribute
it to the same page of the shorthand notes. It is Document M-151,
and I offer it as Exhibit GB-529. It consists of three letters on the
subject of the murder of mental patients in institutions. The first is
dated the 6th of September and addressed by the supervisor of a
sanatorium at Stetten to the Reich Minister of Justice. It sets out
the feeling of insecurity in the neighborhood of the sanatorium
administered by its inspector, in view of the number of deaths
which are occurring.
<span class='pageno' title='435' id='Page_435'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The second, dated the 10th, is a letter from the Minister of
Justice acknowledging the complaint and saying that it has been
passed to the Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the third, of the same date, is the Minister’s letter to his
colleague passing the complaint to him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document is again on the same subject. It is
Document M-152, and I offer it as Exhibit GB-530. It consists of
four letters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first, dated the 19th of July 1940, is addressed to the Defendant
Frick as Reich Minister of the Interior, by Bishop Wurm, the
Provincial Bishop of the Württemberg Evangelical Provincial
Church. My Lord, it again sets out the mass of complaints he is
receiving and then goes on to deal with the wickedness of the practice
which is apparently going on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second letter, dated the 23d of August, is a letter to the
Minister of Justice referring to the letter sent to the Defendant
Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third, of the 5th of September, is a letter to the Defendant
Frick reminding him of the previous letter of the 19th of July to
which no reply had been received.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And, on the 6th of September, the next letter is a parallel communication
again to the Minister of Justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, on the 11th of September, the last page of the document,
there is a memorandum on the Minister of Justice’s file indicating
that an official of the Ministry had informed the Bishop’s dean,
presumably Dean Keppler, that the matter was entirely one for the
Defendant Frick.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the next document, D-455, which I offer as Exhibit
GB-531, is a pamphlet prepared by the German. Military Government
authorities in Belgium. It comes from the files of the German
War Office, the OKW, and it is entitled, <span class='it'>Belgium’s Contributions to
Germany’s War Economy</span>, and is dated the 1st of March 1942.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I offer it in view of the general evidence that German
occupation was benevolent, and that—the Tribunal has heard, again
and again, the suggestion that they did a great deal of good to the
countries they occupied. This document is a very graphic illustration
of the falsity of that evidence out of the mouths of the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, if I might take the Tribunal very quickly through it,
at Page 3 is a chart of the population figures in terms of employees,
and it shows that more than half the working population was
working for Germany. Of the 1,800,000 workers and employees in
Belgium, 901,280 were employed with the German Armed Forces
and in the German interests.
<span class='pageno' title='436' id='Page_436'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, at Page 4 is a comparison between Belgium, Holland,
and France in terms of percentage of workers employed as slave
labor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, at Page 5 is a statement of the production figures for
the Belgian contribution to Germany, in—I think it is the seventh
line, it is summed up: “Output to the value of 1,200 million
Reichsmark.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 6—there is a comparison between the coal taken from Belgium
and the same amount produced in the year in the Ruhr.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 8 there is comparison of iron, with the total amount of
iron used in the West Wall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 9, cement; Page 10, textiles; Page 11, metals. There is a
statement there which contains a sentence about the summing up of
what had been taken out: “It was possible to achieve these results
only by exhausting the last reserves of the country.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 12 there is a chart of how the metal collection has
affected individuals. It is a comparison between Belgium, Holland,
and France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 13 there is a statement about the contribution to traffic;
and a chart on Page 14.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 15 it appears that the contributions in money exceeded
the total earning—earned income of the Belgian workers for the
last year.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At Page 16 there are figures with regard to the quantity of gold
taken for safekeeping in the Reichsbank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Page 18 deals with shares, a comparison with the total share
capital of I. G. Farben, the comparison being 700 million Reichsmark
as against the share capital of I. G. Farben of 800 millions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is a statement with regard to rations, showing that
Germany had imported food into Belgium but that, despite that, the
rationing was the lowest of all western countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And finally, on the last page, there is an indication of the change
in the Belgian rations by comparison between 1938 and under the
benevolent rule of the German Military Government in 1941. My
Lord, it speaks for itself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I—My Lord, the last document, D-524, is a similar
pamphlet referring to France. It comes from the same source, and
I offer it as Exhibit GB-532.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, owing to a breakdown in electric power, I have not
been able to finish photostating the English copies, but I will hand
them in, if I may, subsequently and for the moment I hand up
German photostats.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I offer it in view of the Defendant Sauckel’s evidence,
at Page 10617 of the shorthand notes (Volume XV, Page 52), where
<span class='pageno' title='437' id='Page_437'></span>
he said that the total slave labor figure was not more than 5 millions.
My Lord, at Pages 8 and 9 of this document, the Tribunal will
see the slave labor position of Germany at the end of 1943, so that
to this must be added slave labor drawn in during 1944. My Lord,
it amounts to just under 7 millions, of which 1,462,000 were prisoners
of war, so that the figure of slave labor at the date was slightly over
5 millions; that is, slave labor excluding prisoners of war was
slightly over 5 millions, and to that, as I say, one must add the
increase during 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, on Page 8 are the figures and comparisons: Men,
civilians, 3,631,000; prisoners of war, 1,462,000; women, 1,714,000.
And then it is set out how that is divided by countries. And on
Page 9 is merely an illustration in color.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, the rest of the pamphlet merely gives figures illustrative
of what was taken from France, very similar to those in the
case of Belgium. And I would not propose to take the Tribunal
through it unless it is desired that I should do so.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, I think I gave that a number, Exhibit GB-532.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My Lord, that is all the documents that I have to offer. I understand
my friend, Mr. Dodd, has some.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. JUSTICE ROBERT H. JACKSON (Chief of Counsel for the
United States): May it please the Tribunal, at the time of the cross-examination
of the Defendant Hermann Göring we confronted him
with a document, numbered 3787-PS, It was received as Exhibit
USA-782. It was the report of the second meeting of the Reich
Defense Council. Göring acknowledged the authenticity of the
minutes as presented to him in the German text. But the document
at that time had not been translated, and consequently it was not
possible to read into the record the many parts of that document
which we considered important as bearing upon his credibility and
testimony, and as bearing upon the denials of many other of the
defendants that they knew of the planning of the war and that they
knew—participated in it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I would now like to read from the record part of this which we
consider extremely important as rebuttal testimony received from
several of the defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the face of it, it is a letter of transmittal dated the 10th day
of July 1939, from the supreme command of the Armed Forces, on
the subject, “Second Meeting of the Reich Defense Council.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>One hundred copies were prepared, and our copy is the 84th. It
is labeled “most secret” and merely transmits in the name of the
chief of the supreme command of the Armed Forces the enclosed
document to following parties, among others. I shall name only the
ones to which we have attached some importance: To the Party, the
<span class='pageno' title='438' id='Page_438'></span>
Führer’s Deputy, the first copy; to the Chief of the Reich Chancellery;
to Ministerpräsident, Field Marshal Göring, the Reich
Minister and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force; to the Foreign
Office; to the Plenipotentiary General for Reich Administration are
nine copies, including copies for the Minister of the Interior, the
Minister of Justice, the Minister of Education, the Minister for Church
Affairs, and the Reich Office for Planning; also to the Plenipotentiary
General for Economy, including copies for the Minister of Economy,
the Ministry of Food and Agriculture, the Ministry of Labor, the
Chief Forester, and the Commissioner for Price Control; to the
Minister of Finance; the Minister of Transport, Motor Transport,
and Roads; and the Minister of Railways; the Post Minister; the
Minister of Enlightenment and Propaganda; the Reichsbank Directorate;
the General Inspector of German Roads; the Armed Forces,
including nine copies for the OKH, five copies for the OKM, the
Reich Minister for Air and Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force;
the supreme command of the Armed Forces; a series of other copies
being enclosed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The enclosure is a report of the second meeting of the Reich
Defense Council, held on a date to which we attach importance, the
6th day—the 23d day of June 1939.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Place: Large conference room of the Reich Air Ministry.</p>

<p>“Commencement: 1110; termination: 1355.</p>

<p>“President: Ministerpräsident, General Field Marshal Göring.</p>

<p>“Persons present...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall name only those to which we attach some importance,
because the list is very long:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Führer’s Deputy; the Chief of the Reich Chancellery,
Dr. Lammers; Reichsministerpräsident General Field Marshal
Göring’s staff, Secretary of State Körner, Secretary of State Naumann,
Councillor Bergbohm, and several others; Plenipotentiary
General for Reich Administration, Reichsminister Frick, Reichsführer
SS Himmler and uniformed police, Daluege; Plenipotentiary General
for the Economy, Reichsminister Funk; the Reichsminister of Finance
Von Krosigk; Minister of Transport; General Inspector of German
Roads, Dr. Todt; supreme command of the Armed Forces, Generaloberst
Keitel, Warlimont, and Generalmajor Thomas; supreme
command of the Army, by—from the General Staff, General of
Artillery Halder; supreme command of the Navy, General Admiral—Grossadmiral
Raeder; Reich Minister for Air Force, Milch and
Bodenschatz, both of whom were witnesses here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The contents, summarized, I will not read.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of the meeting:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Ministerpräsident, General Field Marshal Göring emphasized
in a preamble that according to the Führer’s wishes the Reich
<span class='pageno' title='439' id='Page_439'></span>
Defense Council was the determining body in the Reich for
all questions of preparation for war. It is to discuss only the
most important questions of Reich defense. They will be
worked out by the Reich Defense Committee.</p>

<p>“Meetings of the Reich Defense Council are to be convened
only for these decisions which are unavoidable. It is urged
that the departmental chiefs themselves be present.</p>

<p>“Distribution of labor.</p>

<p>“I. The President announced the following directives to
govern the distribution and employment of the population in
wartime.</p>

<p>“1. The total strength of the Armed Forces is determined by
the Führer. It includes only half of the number of those fit
and liable for military service. Nevertheless, their disposition
will involve difficulties for economy, the administration, and
the whole of the civil sphere.</p>

<p>“2. When a schedule of manpower is made out, the basis on
which the question is to be judged is how the remaining number,
after those required for the Armed Forces have been
withdrawn, can be most suitably employed.</p>

<p>“3. Of equal importance to the requirements of the Armed
Forces are those of the armament industry. It, above all, must
be organized in peacetime as regards material and personnel
in such a way that its production does not decrease but
increases immediately with the outbreak of war.</p>

<p>“4. The direction of labor to the vital war armament industry
and to other civilian requirements is the main task of the
Plenipotentiary General for Economy.</p>

<p>“a. War armament covers not only the works producing war
materials, but also those producing synthetic rubber (Buna),
armament production tools, hydrogenation works, coal mining,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p>“b. (1) As a rule, no essential and irreplaceable specialists may
be taken away from ‘war decisive’ factories, on whose
production depends the course of the war, unless they can be
replaced.</p>

<p>“Coal mining is the most urgent work. Every worker who
is essential to coal mining is ‘indispensable.’</p>

<p>“Note: Coal mining has even now become the key point of the
whole armament industry, of communications, and of export.
If the necessary labor is not made available for it now, the
most important part of the export trade, the export of coal,
will cease. The purchase of coal in Poland will stop. The
correct distribution of labor is determinative. In order to be
<span class='pageno' title='440' id='Page_440'></span>
able to man these key points with the right people, severe
demands will shortly be submitted to the Führer which, even
in the current mobilization year, will under certain circumstances
lead to an exceptional war economy, for instance, to
the immobilization of lorries and to the closing down of
unessential factories owing to lack of coal.</p>

<p>“In addition, there is the supplying of Italy and other countries
such as Scandinavia with coal (to maintain the German
supplies of iron).”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall omit certain parts of the document which do not seem
particularly important to our argument and pass to Item 2, Page 9
of the English translation:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“(2) A second category of workers liable for military service
will be called up during the war after their replacements have
been trained. A decisive role is played by the extensive
preliminary training and retraining of workers.</p>

<p>“(3) Preparations must be made for replacing the mass of
other workers liable for military service, even by drawing
on an increased number of women. There are also disabled
servicemen.</p>

<p>“(4) Compulsory work for women is of decisive importance
in wartime. It is important to proceed to a great extent with
the training of women in important war work, as replacements
and to augment the number of male workers.</p>

<p>“(d) In order to avoid confusion when mobilization takes
place, persons working in important war branches, that is,
administration, communications, police, food, will not be
removed at first. It is essential to establish the degrees of
urgency and importance.</p>

<p>“In the interests of the auxiliary civilian service, provided by
every European people to gain and maintain the lead in the
decisive initial weeks of a war, efforts must in this way be
made to insure by an efficient organization that every German
in wartime not only possesses his mobilization orders
but has also been thoroughly prepared for his wartime
activity. The works must also be adapted to receive the
replacements and additional workers.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip to the bottom of Page 10, Item 6:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Plenipotentiary General for Economy is given the task
of settling what work is to be given to prisoners of war, to
those in prison concentration camps and penitentiaries.</p>

<p>“According to a statement by the Reichsführer SS, greater use
will be made of the concentration camps in wartime. The
<span class='pageno' title='441' id='Page_441'></span>
20,000 inmates will be employed mainly in workshops inside
the concentration camps.</p>

<p>“IV. Secretary of State Dr. Syrup, of the Reich Ministry of
Labor, made a report on the allocation of labor in the event
of mobilization and the schedule of manpower for the war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This seems a little detailed; but it is, I think, very important,
showing the totality of the mobilization planned months before the
war started and indicating, as we shall argue, preparations for a
war more extensive than the mere brush with Poland.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The figures for the schedule of manpower, drawn up experimentally,
could only be of a preparatory character and merely
give certain guiding principles. The basis of a population of
79 millions was taken. Of these, 56.5 millions are between the
ages of 14 and 65. It is also possible to draw upon men over
the age of 65 and upon minors of between 13 and 14. The
disabled and the infirm must be deducted from the 56.5 millions.
Most prisoners are already employed in industry. The
greatest deduction is that of 11 million mothers with children
under 14. After deduction of these groups, there remains an
employable population of 43.5 millions: 26.2 million men—after
deducting 7 million members of the Armed Forces, 19.2;
17.3 million women—after deducting 250,000 nurses <span class='it'>et cetera</span>,
17.1 for the whole of Germany’s economic and civil life. The
President does not consider women over the age of 60 as
employable.</p>

<p>“8. The number of workers at present employed and of
employees (two-thirds of the wage workers) distributed over
20 large branches of industry amounts roughly to the following:
24 million men (excluding 2 million service men), 14 million
women.</p>

<p>“9. No information was then available regarding the number
which the Armed Forces will take from the individual
branches of industry. Therefore an estimate was made of the
numbers remaining in the individual branches of industry
after 5 million servicemen had been called up.</p>

<p>“The President’s demand that the exact number liable to
military service be established, is being complied with. These
inquiries are not secret apart from figures given and formations.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall skip the next paragraph, 10, as of no importance.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“11. Apart from the 13.8 million women at present employed,
a further 3.5 million unemployed women, who are listed on
the card index of the population, can be employed.
<span class='pageno' title='442' id='Page_442'></span></p>

<p>“2 million women would have to be redirected; that is, a
transfer can be made to agriculture and to the metal
and chemical industry, from the textile, clothing, and
ceramic industries, from small trading, insurance and banking
businesses, and from the number of women in domestic
service.</p>

<p>“12. The lack of workers in agriculture, from which about
25 percent of the physically fit male workers will be withdrawn,
must be made up by women (2 in the place of 1 man)
and prisoners of war. No foreign workers can be counted on.
The Armed Forces are requested to release to a great extent
owners and specialists such as milkers, tractor drivers,
35 percent of whom are still liable for call-up.</p>

<p>“13. The President emphasized that factory managers, police,
and the Armed Forces must make preparations for the employment
of prisoners of war.</p>

<p>“14. In the agricultural sphere preparations must also be
made to relieve bottlenecks by help from neighboring farms,
systematic use of all machines and laying in stocks of spare
parts.</p>

<p>“15. The President announced that in wartime hundreds of
thousands of workers from nonwar industries in the Protectorate
are to be employed under supervision in Germany,
particularly in agriculture. They are to be housed in barracks.
General Field Marshal Göring will obtain a decision from the
Führer on this matter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall omit 16.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If I may say as I offer this, it seems rather detailed as showing
the extent of preparation already accomplished at the time, in June
of 1939:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“17. a. The result of the procedure of establishing indispensable
and guaranteed workers is at present as follows:
Of 1,172,000 applications for indispensability, 727,000 have
been approved and 233,000 rejected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass to “c” near the bottom of the page:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The orders to supplementary personnel to report for duty are
ready and tied up in bundles at the labor offices.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting proceeds to consider production premiums in connection
with wages, and I pass to 21, a detail which I offer as
indicating that a long war was in anticipation.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“When labor is being regrouped, it is important—and with
specialists even essential—that the workers are retrained for
their work in the new factory, in order to avoid setbacks in
the initial months of the war. After a few months have passed
<span class='pageno' title='443' id='Page_443'></span>
even the replacement of most of the specialists must be
possible.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the Point V:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Plenipotentiary General for Economy, Reich Minister of
Economy Funk, stated his opinion on the fluctuations of the
schedule of manpower, from the viewpoint of the carrying on
of industry.</p>

<p>“24. a. In accordance with the verbal agreements made with
the OKW, the regulations regarding indispensable personnel
have been laid down and the certificates of indispensability
issued.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass to Point Number 25 on Page 15:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“In reply to the request by the speaker that when withdrawing
workers for the naval dockyards, more consideration
should be shown for the important sections of industry,
particularly export and newspaper concerns, the President
pointed out the necessity of carrying out the naval building
program as ordered by the Führer in full.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I pass to the large heading VI:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Plenipotentiary General for Administration, Reich
Minister of the Interior, Dr. Frick, dealt with the saving of
labor in the public administration.</p>

<p>“27. The task is primarily a problem of organization. As can
be seen from the surveys, which were submitted to those attending
the conference, showing how the authorities, economic
and social services are organized, there are approximately
50 different kinds of officials in the district administration,
each quite independent of the other—an impossible state of
affairs. Formerly there were in the State two main divisions,
the state civil service and the Wehrmacht. After the seizure
of power, the Party and the permanent organizations (Reichsnährstand,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>) were added to these, with all their
machinery from top to bottom. In this way the number of
public posts and officials was increased many times over. This
makes public service more difficult.</p>

<p>“28. Since the war tasks have increased enormously.”—The
context makes it clear that that is the preceding war.—“The
organizing of total war naturally requires much more labor,
even in the public administration, than in 1914. But it is an
impossibility that this system should have increased its numbers
20 to 40 fold in the lowest grade alone. For this reason,
the Reich Ministry of the Interior is striving for uniformity of
administration.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='444' id='Page_444'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A small conference—small commission was created. I offer
Number 29 in connection with Göring’s testimony that they ceased
to function:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Instead of further discussions before the whole assembly, the
forming of a small commission which will make definite
proposals is recommended. Extensive preparatory work has
been undertaken.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>And a note by the committee that the committee had been
functioning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Point 30:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The President requested that the commission’s proposals be
submitted. It was an important section for the preparation
for war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass to the large subdivision C which relates to increasing
the efficiency of the communications service, starting with the
receipt of a report from the Army General Staff.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“31. Eighteen months ago the result of the examination of the
plan for strategic concentration showed that the transport
service could not meet all the demands made on it by the
Armed Forces. The Minister of Transport confirmed this statement.
The 1938 part of the Four Year Plan will presumably
be completed in August 1939.</p>

<p>“32. Shortly after this program was drawn up demands were
made on the Wehrmacht which had changed completely compared
with the traditional use of the Wehrmacht at the beginning
of a war. Troops had to be brought to the frontier, in
the shortest possible time, in numbers which had until then
been completely unforeseen. The Wehrmacht was able to fulfill
these demands by means of organizational measures but
transport could not.</p>

<p>“33. In the field of transportation Germany is at the moment
not yet ready for war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I offer the detail which follows, in contradiction of the statements
repeatedly made by a number of witnesses that the movements
of the Wehrmacht in the Rhineland, the Anschluss, and all
the rest of it, even Czechoslovakia, were surprise movements.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“a. In the case of the three operations in 1938/1939 there was
no question of an actual strategic concentration. The troops
were transported a long time beforehand near to the area
of strategic concentration by means of camouflaged measures.</p>

<p>“b. This stop-gap is of no use whatever when the time limit
cannot be fixed or is not known a long time beforehand, but
when an unexpected and almost immediate military decision
<span class='pageno' title='445' id='Page_445'></span>
is required. According to the present situation transport is
not in a position, despite all preparations, to bring up the
troops.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>“a” is unimportant for my purposes, “a” on Page 18. “b” and
“c” represent steps to be taken to meet the deficiency. On Page 19
I shall not bother to read the statements on 38, showing the preparation
of highways from east to west and from north to south.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I read Number 39, if I may:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The President remarked that even in peacetime certain vital
supply stores of industry and the Armed Forces are to be
transferred to the war industrial centers to economize in transport
later on.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I shall pass to Point Number 41 on Page 20:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“To sum up, the President affirmed that all essential points
had been cleared up at this meeting.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The American branch of the Prosecution has some additional
documents which Mr. Dodd will submit, if it is agreeable to the
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Mr. Dodd, you have got some other papers to
put in?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I would like to offer, Mr. President, Document
4006-PS, which is the bulletin of the Reich Minister for Armament
and Ammunition; and it is a matter that the Tribunal, in our judgment,
may take judicial notice of. It is an official publication, but
it will be quite helpful in connection with the labor program as
between Sauckel and Speer; and it is offered for that purpose, to
clear up some of the doubts that may have arisen after the Speer
and Sauckel testimony. I think there is no necessity to read it at
all but simply to offer it. And it would become Exhibit USA-902.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then I would like to offer Document 1452-PS. This is a
report of a conference of the chiefs with the chief of the department
of the Economic Armament Office, and I would just like to
read a short excerpt from it. It is Document 1452-PS, dated the
24th of March 1942. It says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Conferences of the chiefs with the chief of the department.
Report of the chief of the department on the conference on
the 23d of March with Milch, Witzell, Leeb, in Minister Speer’s
office. The Führer looks upon Speer as his principal mouthpiece,
his trusted adviser in all economic spheres. Speer is the
<span class='pageno' title='446' id='Page_446'></span>
only one who has something to say today. He can interfere
in any department. He already disregards all other departments.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>The remainder of the document we do not wish to quote, I do not
think it is necessary because the text is not changed any by what
we have quoted from it. That becomes Exhibit USA-903.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, we also have here some photographs, Mr. President; and
these are offered with respect to the Defendant Kaltenbrunner.
They were turned over to us by our colleagues of the French Prosecution.
And the first one is Document F-894, which becomes Exhibit
USA-904. That is a picture showing Himmler congratulating someone,
Kaltenbrunner immediately to his rear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How are they identified?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I will submit it—well, these are all captured documents,
of course, but—you mean in the picture, Mr. President?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: No, I mean by capture or any other way.
Where do they come from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, I assume them to be all captured documents.
Oh, I see now—there are affidavits attached to each one which
explain their source. Here, this first one is a man by the name of
François Boix, who says that he is a photographer and was interned
at Mauthausen and so on; and he attests that this photograph was
taken, and so forth. I think that is sufficient—I assume it is—to
identify the picture. I believe that each one of them has a similar
statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the next one is Document F-896, which becomes Exhibit
USA-905. And this as well on the back of the original bears an
affidavit by François Boix.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The next one is Document F-897, which becomes Exhibit USA-906.
And this as well, bears the affidavit of François Boix and shows
Kaltenbrunner and Himmler and other SS officials.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And then, lastly, Document F-895, which becomes Exhibit
USA-907; and this picture we particularly call to the Tribunal’s
attention. It, as well, bears the certificate of François Boix. Kaltenbrunner
is there in the second row, Himmler and Hitler in the
immediate center between Kaltenbrunner and, apparently, Martin
Bormann, taken at a concentration camp, which appears from the
picture of the inmates on the left side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then we wish to offer a very short affidavit, which is Document
4033-PS and we offer as Exhibit USA-907—no, 8, 908. It is the deposition
of Oswald Pohl, P-o-h-l, dated the 28th of May 1946. The affidavit—the
substance of the affidavit reads as follows:
<span class='pageno' title='447' id='Page_447'></span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I can say with absolute certainty that while on official business
at Mauthausen I saw and spoke to SS Obergruppenführer
Kaltenbrunner...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: One moment. Was Pohl called as a witness?</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: No, Sir, he was not, he was not called. That was
Puhl, P-u-h-l. The names are similar.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...I saw and spoke to SS Obergruppenführer Kaltenbrunner
there at the officers’ mess on the right-hand side of the camp
entrance either in the autumn of 1943 or the spring of 1944.
I took lunch with him there at the mess table.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And then another affidavit, Document 4032-PS, which becomes
Exhibit USA-908—no, 909. I think it is unnecessary to read this;
it has been translated. It is the deposition of one Karl Reif, R-e-i-f,
in which he states that he saw Kaltenbrunner either in May or June,
about midday, in 1942 in the camp at Mauthausen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all we have to offer, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the other members of the Prosecution
wish to offer any other evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then now we can pass to evidence to be called on behalf of Bormann.
Dr. Bergold, will you call the witnesses you wish to call—Kempka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Gentlemen of the Tribunal, I shall call the witness
Kempka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness Kempka took the stand.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you state your full name, please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>ERICH KEMPKA (Witness): My name is Erich Kempka.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Will you repeat this oath after me: I swear
by God—the Almighty and Omniscient:—that I will speak the pure
truth—and will withhold and add nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The witness repeated the oath.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may sit down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Witness, in what capacity were you employed
near Hitler during the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: During the war I worked for Adolf Hitler as his personal
driver.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Did you meet Martin Bormann in that capacity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, I met Martin—Reichsleiter Martin Bormann in
this capacity at that time as my indirect superior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Witness, on what day did you see the Defendant
Martin Bormann for the last time?
<span class='pageno' title='448' id='Page_448'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I saw the Reichsleiter, the former Reichsleiter Martin
Bormann, on the night of 1-2 May 1945 near the Friedrichstrasse
railroad station, at the Weidendammer Bridge. Reichsleiter Bormann—former
Reichsleiter Bormann—asked me what the general
situation was at the Friedrichstrasse station, and I told him that
there at the station it was hardly possible...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are going too fast. He asked you what?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: He asked me what the situation was and whether one
could get through there at the Friedrichstrasse station. I told him
that was practically impossible, since the defensive fighting there
was too heavy. Then he went on to ask whether it might be possible
to do so with armored cars. I told him that there was nothing like
trying it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then a few tanks and a few SPW (armored personnel carrier)
cars came along, and small groups boarded them and hung on. Then
the armored cars pushed their way through the antitank trap and
afterwards the leading tank—along about at the middle of the tank
on the left-hand side, where Martin Bormann was walking—suddenly
received a direct hit, I imagine from a bazooka fired from
a window, and this tank was blown up. A flash of fire suddenly shot
up on the very side where Bormann was walking and I saw...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You are going too fast. You are still going
much too fast. The last thing I heard you say was that Bormann was
walking in the middle of the column. Is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, at the middle of the tank, on the left-hand side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then, after it had got 40 to 50 meters past the antitank trap, this
tank received a direct hit, I imagine from a bazooka fired from a
window. The tank was blown to pieces right there where Martin—Reichsleiter
Bormann—was walking.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I myself was flung aside by the explosion and by a person
thrown against me who had been walking in front of me—I think
it was Standartenführer Dr. Stumpfecker—and I became unconscious.
When I came to myself I could not see anything either; I was blinded
by the flash. Then I crawled back again to the tank trap, and since
then I have seen nothing more of Martin Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Witness, did you see Martin Bormann collapse
in the flash of fire when it occurred?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, indeed, I still saw a movement which was a sort
of collapsing. You might call it a flying away.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Was this explosion so strong that according to
your observation Martin Bormann must have lost his life by it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, I assume for certain that the force of the explosion
was such that he lost his life.
<span class='pageno' title='449' id='Page_449'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: How was Martin Bormann dressed at that time?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Martin Bormann was wearing a leather coat, an SS
leader’s cap, and the insignia of an SS Obergruppenführer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Do you therefore believe that if he had been
found wounded on that occasion he would have been immediately
identified, by this clothing, as being one of the leading men of the
Movement?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: You said that another man was walking either
beside or ahead of Martin Bormann, namely a Herr Naumann of
the Propaganda Ministry?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, it was the former State Secretary, Dr. Naumann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Was he approximately at the same distance from
the explosion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, he was about 1 or 2 meters ahead of Martin
Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Have you seen anything of this State Secretary
Naumann subsequently?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I have not seen him again either, nor Standartenführer
Dr. Stumpfecker.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Then you crawled back, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: And nobody else followed you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Certainly. Always, when you passed this antitank
trap, you would run into defensive fire; a few only would remain
lying on the spot while the rest always retreated. But those on that
tank I have never seen again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Gentlemen of the Tribunal, I have no further
questions for this witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I have no questions, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the Defense Counsel want to ask him any
questions?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>There was no response.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>Turning to the witness.</span>] How many tanks were there in this
column?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: That I cannot say at the moment—possibly two or
three. There may have been four, but there were more SPW cars,
armored personnel carriers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How many were there of them?
<span class='pageno' title='450' id='Page_450'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: More and more came up, and then some of them
drove away again. They tried to break through at that point. Possibly
one or two tried. The others withdrew after the tank was
blown up.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where did the column start from?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: That I do not know. They came quite suddenly—there
they were, I assume that they were tanks which had withdrawn
into the middle of the town and were also trying to break
out in a southerly direction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: When you say they were there suddenly,
where do you mean they were? Where did they pick you up?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I was not picked up. I left the Reich Chancellery...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, where did they join you? Where did
you first see them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: At the Weidendammer Bridge, behind the Friedrichstrasse
station. They turned up there during the night.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where was it that Bormann first asked you
whether it would be possible to get through?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: That was at the tank barrier behind the Friedrichstrasse
station at the Weidendammer Bridge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do you mean that you met him in the street?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes. Martin Bormann was not present when we left
the Reich Chancellery; he did not appear at the bridge until between
2 and 3 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You met him there just by chance, do you
mean?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I only met him by chance, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Was there anybody with him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: State Secretary Dr. Naumann from the Ministry of
Propaganda was with him, as well as Dr. Stumpfecker who had been
the last doctor who was with the Führer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How far were they from the Reich Chancellery?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: That is—are—up to—from the Reich Chancellery to
the Friedrichstrasse station is approximately a quarter of an hour’s
walk under normal circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then you saw some tanks and some other
armored vehicles coming along, is that right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, yes indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: German tanks and German armored vehicles?
<span class='pageno' title='451' id='Page_451'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, German armored cars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Did you have any conversation with the
drivers of them?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I did not talk to the drivers. I think State Secretary—former
State Secretary Dr. Naumann did.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then you did not get into the tanks or the
armored vehicles?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, we did not get in—neither State Secretary
Dr. Naumann nor Reichsleiter Bormann.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You just walked along?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I just walked along, yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And where were you with reference to Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I was behind the tank, about—on the left-hand side
behind the tank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: How far from Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: It was perhaps 3 or 4 meters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then some missile struck the tank, is that
right?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I believe the tank was hit by a bazooka fired
from a window.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then you saw a flash and you became
unconscious?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, I suddenly saw a flash of fire and in the fraction
of a second I also saw Reichsleiter Bormann and State Secretary
Naumann both make a movement as if collapsing and flying away.
I myself was thrown aside with them at that same moment and subsequently
lost consciousness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: And then you crept away?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: When I recovered I could not see anything and then
I crawled away and crawled until I bumped my head against the
tank barrier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where did you go to that night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I waited there for a while, and then I said farewell
to my drivers, some of whom were still there; and then I stayed in
the ruins of Berlin, and on the following day I left Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Where were you captured?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I was captured at Berchtesgaden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): How near were you to the tank
when it exploded?
<span class='pageno' title='452' id='Page_452'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I estimate 3 to 4 meters.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And how near was Bormann to
the tank when it exploded?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I assume that he was holding on to it with one hand.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Well, you say you assume it. Did
you see him or did you not see him?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I did not see him on the tank itself. But to keep
pace with the tank I had done the same thing and had held on to
the tank at the back.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Did you see Bormann trying to
get on the tank just before the explosion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I did not see that. I did not see any effort on
Bormann’s part which indicated that he wanted to climb onto the
tank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): How long before the explosion
were you looking at Bormann?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: All this happened in a very brief period. When I was
still talking to Bormann the tanks turned up and we passed the
tank trap right away and after 30 or 40 meters the tank was hit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): What do you call a brief period?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Well, while we were talking, that was perhaps a few
minutes only.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And how long between the conversation
and the explosion?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I cannot tell you the exact time, but surely it was
not a quarter of an hour, or perhaps rather not half an hour.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Had you been in the Chancellery
just before this?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I left the Reich Chancellery in the evening about
9 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Have you ever told this story to
anyone else?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I have been interrogated several times on this subject
and have already made the same statement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): And who took your interrogation,
some officers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE TRIBUNAL (Mr. Biddle): Of what army, what nations?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I have been interrogated by various officers of the
American Army, the first time at Berchtesgaden, the second time
at Freising, and the third time at Oberursel.
<span class='pageno' title='453' id='Page_453'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: As a result of the Court’s inquiry there are one or
two questions that occur to me that I think perhaps should be
brought out which I would like to ask the witness, if I may.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Certainly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You were with Bormann, were you, at 9 o’clock in
the bunker in the Reich Chancellery on that night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, indeed. I saw him for the last time about
9 o’clock in the evening. When I said farewell to Dr. Goebbels, I
also saw Martin Bormann down in the cellar; and then I saw him
again during the night about 2 or 3 o’clock in the morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, maybe you said so, but I did not get it if you
did. Where did you see him at 2 or 3 in the morning prior to the
time that you started to walk with him along with the tank?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Before that I saw him at the Friedrichstrasse station
between 2 or 3 in the morning, and before that I saw him for the
last time at 21 hours in the Reich Chancellery on the preceding
evening.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well I know you did. But did not you and Bormann
have any conversation about how you would get out of Berlin when
you left the Reich Chancellery bunker at about 9 o’clock that night?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I took my orders from the former Brigadeführer
Milunke. I was not receiving direct orders from Reichsleiter Bormann
any more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I did not ask you if you got an order from him. I
asked if you and Bormann had not—and whoever else was there—had
not discussed how you would get out of Berlin. It was 9 o’clock
at night and the situation was getting pretty desperate. Did you not
talk about how you would get out that night? There were not many
of you there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Oh yes, there were about 400 to 500 people in all still
in the Reich Chancellery and those 400 or 500 people were divided
into separate groups, and these groups left the Chancellery one
by one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I know there may have been that many in the
Chancellery. I am talking about that bunker that you were in. You
testified about this before, have you not? You told people that you
knew that Hitler was dead as well as Bormann. And you must
have been in the bunker if you know that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: Yes, I have already testified to that effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Well, what I want to find out is whether or not you
and Bormann and whoever was left in that bunker talked about
leaving Berlin that night before you left the bunker?
<span class='pageno' title='454' id='Page_454'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I did not speak about it any more to Reichsleiter
Bormann at that time. We had marching orders only to the effect
that if we were successful we should report at Fehrbellin where
there was a combat group which we were to join.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: You are the only man who has been able to testify
that Hitler is dead and the only one who has been able to testify
that Bormann is dead, is that so, so far as you know?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I can state that Hitler is dead and that he died on
30 April in the afternoon between 2 and 3 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I know, but you did not see him die either, did you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: No, I did not see him die.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: And you told the interrogators that you believe you
carried his body out of the bunker and set it on fire. Are you not
the man who has said that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I carried out Adolf Hitler’s wife, and I saw Adolf
Hitler himself wrapped in a blanket.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: Did you actually see Hitler?</p>

<p class='pindent'>KEMPKA: I did not see all of him. The blanket in which he was
wrapped was rather short, and I only saw his legs hanging out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MR. DODD: I do not think I will inquire any further, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I have no further questions either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The witness can retire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: Gentlemen of the Tribunal, the witness Walkenhorst
is also still present here. It appears to me that there is a
misunderstanding between the High Tribunal and myself. I stated
Saturday that I did not wish to call any more witnesses besides
the witness Kempka, and I expressly waive the witness Walkenhorst.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What was he? What did you ask for him
to prove in the first instance?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: I had originally called him as a substitute...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We have got your application.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. BERGOLD: But after talking to witness Klöpfer, whom I
have also waived, I am also waiving the witness Walkenhorst
because he does not appear to me to be competent enough to
testify on what I wanted him to testify about.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My entire presentation of evidence, therefore, is now completed,
except for the two documents which the Tribunal have already
granted me, namely, the decree about stopping the measures against
the churches and Bormann’s decree from the year 1944, with which
he forbade members of the Chancellery to be members of the SD.
<span class='pageno' title='455' id='Page_455'></span>
Those two documents I have not yet received. When I have
received them I shall submit them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Servatius, you have some question or affidavit you wanted
to get from this witness Walkenhorst, did you not?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I have an affidavit from this witness Walkenhorst
which deals briefly with the question of the telephone conversation
which Sauckel had at that time about the evacuation of
the Buchenwald Camp. He has been accused of having ordered
the evacuation of the camp when the American army approached.
Now this witness Walkenhorst has accidently been found and it
turns out that oddly enough he was the man with whom Sauckel
spoke. He has confirmed to me in an affidavit that Sauckel demanded
that the camp should be surrendered in an orderly way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is all I wanted to ask this witness. I can submit it here
in the form of an affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Do the Prosecution want the man called
or will the affidavit do?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: I am satisfied with handing over the affidavit.</p>

<p class='pindent'>COL. PHILLIMORE: My Lord, as far as the Prosecution are
concerned, an affidavit would suffice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SERVATIUS: Then I shall submit the affidavit and I will
give the exhibit number together with my list.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, there is one other matter to which I
wish to draw the attention of defendants’ counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Tribunal have been informed as to the length of the
speeches of certain of the defendants’ counsel which have been
placed before the Translation Division for translation, and in the
case of the Defendant Keitel and in the case of the Defendant Jodl
the speeches which have been put into the Translation Division
seem to be very much longer than the Tribunal had anticipated
and quite impossible to be spoken in 1 day.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would counsel for the Defendant Keitel explain to the Tribunal
why that is and what steps he has taken to shorten his speech?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, I have sent a letter to the Court
today which I believe is not yet in the Tribunal’s possession. In
it I requested that in the case of the Defendant Keitel I should
be permitted to exceed the regular length of time, which had been
limited to 1 day for the big cases. When, at the request of the
Tribunal, I stated the time which my final speech would take, I
had my manuscript completed. This manuscript would have taken
about 7 hours. I gave that manuscript to the Translation Division
<span class='pageno' title='456' id='Page_456'></span>
in that form because it was no longer possible to alter it. I submitted
the first part last Wednesday and then the second part on
Saturday morning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If the Tribunal, in accordance with its decision, fixes 1 day, that
is, 5½ hours of actual speech, as the maximum and is unwilling
to depart from that ruling in any case, not even in the case of the
Defendant Keitel, who has been particularly seriously implicated,
then I shall be forced to eliminate certain passages from the
manuscript and to submit them only in writing. I hope the Tribunal
will also decide whether that is possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, the Tribunal takes note of the
fact that when you were asked how long your speech would take,
you said, I think, 7 hours.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: 7 hours. Well, according to the estimate
which has been given to the Tribunal, the speech which you submitted
for translation would take about 13 hours. That is nearly
double as long as you yourself said, and it is almost exactly double
the length of the speech which has been submitted for the Defendant
Ribbentrop, whose case is almost as extensive if not quite as
extensive; and it appears to the Tribunal to be out of all reason
to put in a speech which will probably take nearly double the time
that you yourself stated. The speech you put in is more than
double the length of the speech which has been put in on behalf
of the Defendant Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Naturally, I am unable to know by what points of
view the counsel for Reich Marshal Göring or Foreign Minister
Von Ribbentrop are guided and governed. I can only be guided
by my own views and sense of duty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps that is a matter of comparison, it
is true, but you said 7 hours yourself, and you now put in a
speech which will probably take 13.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I believe, Mr. President, that I shall make that
speech in 7 hours, if I have 7 hours speaking time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal has given this matter a
very full consideration, as you are aware; and they have said that
every speech must be made in 1 day and that will take up some
considerable time for the whole of the defendants to make their
speeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, I shall wait for your decision. If
I am confined to 1 day, then I shall have to leave out certain parts
from my manuscript. But in that case I should have to ask that
the remainder be taken cognizance of by the Tribunal, because
<span class='pageno' title='457' id='Page_457'></span>
every thing that I have included in my manuscript is the minimum
of what should be delivered on such a comprehensive case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, we will consider that application
for you to be allowed to put in the other passages in your speech;
and we will let defendants’ counsel know what our decision is
upon that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Siemers, the Tribunal has now received a full report showing
the immense trouble taken by the Secretariat to find or to try and
find the witness Schulze, Otto Schulze, for you since you first asked
for him in February of this year; and the Tribunal would like to
know what steps you have taken in the meantime to try and
find him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: I believe, Mr. President, that there was no need
to find the witness because, actually, it was known that he was
living in Hamburg-Blankenese and because, in my opinion, he is
still in Hamburg-Blankenese; and I have given this address to the
General Secretariat many times.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, you knew what the General Secretary’s
office were doing about the matter. You knew that they were
unable to find him at the address. You knew that they had sent
the interrogatories to Washington because they were told he had
been taken over there, and we are told that you have been in
Hamburg yourself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SIEMERS: That the interrogatory was sent to Washington
is something which I have known only since last Friday, after
my return from Hamburg. I personally did not anticipate that
such a mistake or such a misunderstanding could arise. Unfortunately,
I also do not know how it did arise. Far be it from
me to make any kind of accusation. I have merely requested that
if the document were received, then the Tribunal should agree to
receive it in evidence later. Unfortunately, I cannot submit it today.
I immediately informed the General Secretariat of the address
once more; I do not know anything more than this address in
Hamburg, either. In my opinion, Admiral Schulze is not in captivity.
It is possible that during my absence some misunderstanding
occurred, but I myself heard that only last Friday.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I cannot understand why, during all
these months that you have been here and have had full opportunity
of seeing the General Secretary and have received all the
assistance which you and all the other defendants’ counsel have
received from the General Secretariat, that you should not have
helped the General Secretary better to find this witness. That is all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We will adjourn now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 4 July 1946, at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: If you please, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has received your letter of the
17th of June of this year, signed by the Defendant Walter Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Yes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal proposes to take notice of that;
and if you will read it, it will then become a part of the record. So
if you will read it to us now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Mr. President, at the moment I do not have the
letter with me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may have my copy, but that is in English.
The Tribunal would wish you to do it at 2 o’clock, then—to
read that letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: Thank you, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The same observation applies to Dr. Exner’s
letter of the 23d of June 1946 on behalf of the Defendant Jodl; only
the Tribunal thinks that that letter also should be signed by the
defendant, and read by Dr. Exner at 2 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I call on Dr. Jahrreiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DR. HERMANN JAHRREISS (Counsel for Defendant
Jodl): Mr. President and Gentlemen of the Tribunal, the main
juridical and fundamental problem of this Trial concerns war as a
function forbidden by international law; the breach of peace as
treason perpetrated upon the world constitution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This problem dwarfs all other juridical questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The four chief prosecutors have discussed the problem in their
opening speeches, sometimes as the central theme of their presentation,
sometimes as a fundamental matter, while indeed differing
in their conceptions thereof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is now up to the Defense to examine it. The body of Defense
Counsel have asked me to conduct this examination. It is true that
<span class='pageno' title='459' id='Page_459'></span>
it is for each counsel to decide whether and to what extent he feels
in a position to renounce, as a result of my arguments, his own
presentation of the question of breach of the peace. However, I
have reason to believe that counsel will avail themselves of this
opportunity to such an extent that the intention of the Defense to
contribute materially toward a technical simplification of the phase
of the Trial which is now beginning, will be realized by my speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am concerned entirely with the juridical question, not with the
appreciation of the evidence submitted during the past months.
Also, I am dealing only with the problems of law as it is at present
valid, not with the problem of such law as could or should be
demanded in the name of ethics or of human progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My task is purely one of research; research desires nothing but
the truth, knowing full well that its goal can never be attained and
that its path is therefore without end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I wish to thank the General Secretary of the Tribunal for having
placed at my disposal documents of a decisive nature and very
important literature. Without this chivalrous assistance it would not
have been possible, under the conditions obtaining at present in
Germany, to complete my work. The literature accessible to me
originated predominantly in the United States. Familiar as I am
with the vast French and English literature on this subject, which
I have studied during the last quarter of a century—I am, unfortunately,
not conversant with the Russian language—I believe,
however, that I can fairly say that no important concept has been
overlooked, because in no other country of the world has the discussion
of our problem, which has become the great problem of
humanity, been more comprehensive and more profound than in
the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This very fact has enabled me to forego the use of legal literature
published in the former German sphere of control. In this way
even the semblance of a <span class='it'>pro domo</span> line of argumentation will be
avoided.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Owing to the short time at my disposal for the purpose of this
speech, and at the same time in view of the abundance and complexity
of the problems with which I have to deal, it will not be
possible for me to cite all the documents and quotations I am referring
to. I shall present only a few sentences. Any other procedure
would interrupt the train of argument for the listener. I shall
therefore submit to the Tribunal the documents and literary
references in the form of appendices to my juridical arguments.
What I am saying can thus quickly be verified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter threatens individuals with punishment for breaches
of the peace between states. It would appear that the Tribunal is
<span class='pageno' title='460' id='Page_460'></span>
accepting the Charter as the unchallengeable foundation for all
juridical considerations. This means that the tribunal will not
examine the question whether the Charter, as a whole or in parts,
is open to juridical objections; yet such a question nevertheless
continues to exist.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this is so, why, then, have any discussion at all on the main
fundamental legal problems?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British chief prosecutor even made it the central theme of
his long address to examine the relationship of the Charter, where
our problem is concerned, to existing international law. He justified
the necessity of his arguments by saying that it was the task of this
Trial to serve humanity and that this task could be fulfilled by the
Trial only if the Charter could hold its own before international
law, that is, if punishment of individuals for breach of the peace
between states was established in existing international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, indeed, necessary to clarify whether certain stipulations of
the Charter may have created new laws, and consequently laws
with retroactive force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a clarification does not serve the purpose of facilitating
the work of the historians. They will examine this, just as all the
other findings in this Trial, according to the rules of free research;
perhaps through many years of work and certainly without limiting
the questions to be put and, if possible, on the basis of an ever
greater wealth of documents and evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a clarification is indispensable, if only for the reason that
the decision as to right and wrong depends, or may depend, thereupon,
all the more so if the Charter is considered legally unassailable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us assume for the sake of argument that the Charter does
not formulate criminal law which is already valid but creates new,
and therefore retroactive, criminal law. What does this signify for
the verdict? Must not this be of importance for the question of guilt?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Possibly the retroactive law which, for instance, penalizes aggressive
war had not yet become fixed or even conceived in the
conscience of humanity at the time when the act was committed.
In that case the defendant cannot be guilty, either before himself
or before others, in the sense that he was aware of the illegality of
his behavior. Possibly, on the other hand, the retroactive law was
promulgated at a time when a fresh conscience was just beginning
to take shape, although not yet clear or universal. It is then quite
possible for the defendant to be not guilty in the sense that he was
aware of the wrongfulness of his commissions and omissions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the point of view of the European continental conception
of penal law, the fact that a person was not aware of doing wrong
is certainly a point which the Tribunal must not overlook.
<span class='pageno' title='461' id='Page_461'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the question as to whether the penal law contained in the
Charter is <span class='it'>ex post facto</span> penal law does not present any difficulty as
long as the stipulations of the Charter are unequivocal and the
prescriptions of international law as applying to date are uncontested.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But what if we have regulations capable of different interpretations
before us or if the concepts of international law are
the subject of controversy? Let us take the first: A stipulation
of the Charter is ambiguous and therefore requires interpretation.
According to one justifiable interpretation the stipulation appears
to be an <span class='it'>ex post facto</span> law; according to another, which can be
equally well justified, it does not. Let us take the second: The
regulation is clear or has been clarified by interpretation of the
Court, but experts on international law are of different opinions
as to the legal position applying to date; it is not certain whether
we are not concerned with an <span class='it'>ex post facto</span> law. In both cases
it is relevant whether the defendant was conscious of the wrongfulness
of his behavior.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I intend to demonstrate how important these considerations are
in this Trial, and shall now begin the examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The starting points of the British and French chief prosecutors
are fundamentally different.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The British chief prosecutor argues as follows, if I understood
him correctly:</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the unrestricted right of states to wage war was abolished
in part by the League of Nations Covenant, later as a general
principle by the Kellogg-Briand Pact, which continues to be the
nucleus of world peace order to this very day. War, thus prohibited,
is a punishable violation of law within and toward the community
of nations, and any individual who has acted in a responsible capacity
is punishable. Secondly, the indictment of individuals for breach
of the peace, although novel, not only represents a moral necessity,
but is in fact long overdue in the evolution of law; it is quite simply
the logical result of the new legal position. Only in outward appearance
does the Charter create new law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And if I understood the British chief prosecutor correctly, he is
asserting that since the conclusion of the Pact of Paris there exists
a clear legal order based on the entire world’s uniform conviction
as to what is right. Since 1927 the United States have negotiated
first with France, then with the remaining Great Powers, with the
exception of the Soviet Union, and also with some of the smaller
powers concerning the conclusion of a treaty intended to abolish
war. Secretary of State Kellogg stated (in a note to the French
Ambassador, 27 February 1928) with memorable impressiveness
what the Government in Washington were striving for, namely:
<span class='pageno' title='462' id='Page_462'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The powers should renounce war as an instrument of national
politics, waiving all legal definitions and acting from a practical
point of view, plainly, simply, and unambiguously, without qualifications
or reservations.<a id='r1'/><a href='#f1' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[1]</span></sup></a> Otherwise the object desired would not be
attained: To abolish war as an institution, that is, as an institution
of international law.<a id='r2'/><a href='#f2' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[2]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>After the negotiations had been concluded, Aristide Briand, the
other of the two statesmen from whose initiative springs that pact
which in Germany is often called the “Pact to Outlaw War,” declared,
when it was signed in Paris:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Formerly deemed a divine right and remaining in international
law as a prerogative of sovereignty, such a war has
now at last been legally stripped of that which constituted its
greatest danger: its legitimacy. Branded henceforth as illegal,
it is truly outlawed by agreement....”<a id='r3'/><a href='#f3' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[3]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>According to the conception of both leading statesmen, the Paris
Pact amounted to a change of the world order at its very roots, if
only all, or almost all, nations of the world—and particularly all the
great powers—signed the pact or adhered to it later on, which did
actually happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The change was to be based on the following conception: Up to
the time of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, war had been an institution of
international law. After the Kellogg-Briand Pact, war was high
treason against the order created by international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many politicians and scholars all over the world shared this
conception. It is the definite basic conception of that unique commentary
on the League of Nations Covenant by which Jean Ray, far
beyond the borders of France, stirred the hearts of all practical and
theoretical proponents of the idea of preventing war.<a id='r4'/><a href='#f4' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[4]</span></sup></a> It is also the
basic conception of the Indictment at Nuremberg.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='463' id='Page_463'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Diplomacy and the doctrine of international law found their way
back into their old tracks after the first World War, after a momentary
shock from which they recovered with remarkable rapidity.
This fact horrified all those who were anxious to see the conclusions—all
the conclusions—drawn from the catastrophe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mankind had a “grand vision of world peace” then, as Senator
Bruce called it when the Pact of Paris was before the Senate for
ratification.<a id='r5'/><a href='#f5' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[5]</span></sup></a> I know how much the personality and the achievements
of Woodrow Wilson are a subject of dispute. But the more detachment
we achieve, the clearer it becomes that he—by making fortunate
use of his own preparatory work and of that of others<a id='r6'/><a href='#f6' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[6]</span></sup></a>—finally
conceived and presented to the humanity of the time an
entirely brilliant train of thought which is as right today as it was
then, and which can best be condensed as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is necessary to start afresh. The tragic chain of wars and
mere armistices termed peace must be broken. Sometime humanity
must have the insight and the will to pass from war to real peace,
that is, to peace which is good in its essence, founded on existing
legal principles, without regard to victory or defeat; and this peace,
which is good in its essence, must be maintained—and maintained
in good condition—by an organized union of states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These aims can only be achieved if the most frequent causes of
war are eliminated, namely excessive armaments, secret treaties,
and the consecration—detrimental to life—of the <span class='it'>status quo</span> as a
result of lack of insight on the part of the possessor of the moment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Humanity did not follow this path. And it is not to be wondered
at that among those who fought against the instruments of Versailles,
St. Germain, Trianon, Neuilly, and Sèvres, be it in the camp
of the vanquished or in that of the victors, were the very ones who
strove after real, lasting peace. When the Governments of the South
African Union and Canada, in their replies to Secretary of State
Hull’s Principles of Enduring Peace of 16 July 1937, indicated in
unusually strong language that a revision of unjust and forcibly
imposed treaties was an indispensable precondition for real world
peace, they took up one of the basic views of the great American
President.<a id='r7'/><a href='#f7' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[7]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='464' id='Page_464'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Humanity did not follow Wilson.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even for the members of the League of Nations war remained a
means for settling disputes, prohibited in individual cases, but
normal on the whole. Jean Ray<a id='r8'/><a href='#f8' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[8]</span></sup></a>, as late as 1930, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The League of Nations did not prove to be a guide to the
true order of peace, indeed it did not even prove to be a
sufficient brake to prevent a complete backward movement
into the former state. For the world did in fact slide back
entirely.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>For this is the all-important factor in our problem of law. Before
the commencement of the second World War the whole system of
collective security, even in such scanty beginnings as it had made,
had collapsed;<a id='r9'/><a href='#f9' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[9]</span></sup></a> and this collapse was acknowledged and declared
expressly, or by equivalent action, by three world powers—and, in
fact, declared with full justification. Great Britain clearly stated
this at the beginning of the war to the League of Nations. I shall
show this immediately.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Soviet Union treated the German-Polish conflict simply
according to the rules of classical international law concerning
debellatio. I shall explain this shortly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States declared their strict neutrality. I shall also
explain the import of this declaration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The system of collective security has been the subject of much
dispute. In this matter involving the world’s conscience, which is of
fundamental importance in this very Trial, it cannot be a matter of
indifference that the system, rightly or wrongly, appeared in 1938
to such a prominent specialist on international law as the American,
Edwin Borchard, to be absolutely inimical to peace and the offspring
of the hysteria of our age.<a id='r10'/><a href='#f10' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[10]</span></sup></a> The collapse may have had various
causes; it is certain that the above-mentioned three world powers
testified at the beginning of September 1939 to the collapse—the
complete collapse—and that they did not, in fact, do so as a consequence
of the German-Polish war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To begin with, on 7 September 1939 the British Foreign Office
told the Secretary General of the League of Nations<a id='r11'/><a href='#f11' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[11]</span></sup></a> that the
British Government had assumed the obligation, on 5 February 1930,
<span class='pageno' title='465' id='Page_465'></span>
to answer before the Permanent International Court of Justice at
The Hague whenever a complaint was filed against Great Britain,
which would include all cases of complaints which other states might
lodge on account of conduct whereby Great Britain in a war had,
in the opinion of the plaintiff, violated international law. The British
Government had accepted this regulation because they had relied
on the functioning of the machinery of collective security created
by the League of Nations Covenant and the Pact of Paris—because,
if it did function properly, and since Britain would certainly not
conduct any forbidden wars, her opponent on the contrary being
the aggressor, no collision between Britain and those states that
were faithful to the security machinery could possibly be caused by
any action of Britain as a seapower.<a id='r12'/><a href='#f12' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[12]</span></sup></a> However, the British Government
had been disappointed in this confidence: Ever since the
League Assembly of 1938 it had no longer been possible to doubt
that the security machinery would not function; on the contrary it
had, in fact, collapsed completely. A number of members of the
League had already declared their strict neutrality before the outbreak
of war:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The entire machinery intended to maintain peace has broken
down.”<a id='r13'/><a href='#f13' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[13]</span></sup></a></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I will proceed to show how right the British Government were
in the conclusions they drew. It should not be forgotten that the
British Premier, Mr. Neville Chamberlain, had already proclaimed,
on 22 February 1938 in the House of Commons, that is, before the
so-called Austrian Anschluss, the complete inefficiency of the system
of collective security. He said:<a id='r14'/><a href='#f14' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[14]</span></sup></a></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At the last election it was still possible to hope that the
League might afford collective security. I believed it myself.
I do not believe it now. I would say more: If I am right, as I
am confident I am, in saying that the League as constituted
today is unable to provide collective security for anybody,
then I say we must not delude ourselves, and, still more, we
must not try to delude small weak nations into thinking that
they will be protected by the League against aggression and
acting accordingly, when we know that nothing of the kind
can be expected.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The Geneva League of Nations was “neutralized,” as Noel Baker
politely expressed it later in the House of Commons.<a id='r15'/><a href='#f15' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='466' id='Page_466'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Secondly, in view of the correct conclusions drawn by the British
Government and expressed in their note of 7 September 1939 to the
League of Nations, it is no wonder that the Soviet Union treated the
German-Polish conflict in accordance with the old rules of power
politics. In the German-Russian Frontier and Friendship Pact of
28 September 1939 and in the declaration made on the same day in
common with the Reich Government,<a id='r15a'/><a href='#f15a' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[15a]</span></sup></a> the Moscow Government
bases its stand on the conception of the <span class='it'>debellatio</span> of Poland, that
is, the liquidation of Poland’s government and armed forces; no
mention is made of the Pact of Paris or the League of Nations
Covenant. The Soviet Union takes note of the liquidation of the
Polish state machinery by means of war, and from this fact draws
the conclusions which it deems right, agreeing with the Reich
Government that the new order of things is exclusively a matter
for the two powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was therefore only logical that in the Finnish conflict, during
the winter of 1939-1940, the Soviet Union should have taken its
stand on classical international law. It disregarded the reactions of
the League of Nations when, without even considering the application
of the machinery of sanctions and merely pretending to apply
an article of the Covenant referring to quite different matters, that
body resolved that the Soviet Union had, as an aggressor, placed
itself outside the League.<a id='r16'/><a href='#f16' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[16]</span></sup></a> The report of the Swiss Federal Council
of 30 January 1940 to the Federal Assembly endeavored to save the
face of the League which was excluded from all political realities.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thirdly, the President of the United States stated on 5 September
1939 that there existed a state of war between several states with
whom the United States lived in peace and friendship, namely, Germany
on the one hand, and Great Britain, France, Poland, India, and
two of the British dominions on the other. Everyone in the United
States was required to conform with neutrality regulations in the
strictest manner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the time of the preliminary negotiations, it was a well-known
fact in the United States that Europe, and particularly Great
Britain and France, saw the main value of the Pact to Outlaw War
in the fact that the United States would take action in case of a
breach of the pact. The British Foreign Secretary stated this on
30 July 1928, that is, 4 weeks previous to the signing of the pact.
During the deliberations of the American Senate on the ratification
of the pact, Senator Moses drew particular attention to this.<a id='r17'/><a href='#f17' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[17]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='467' id='Page_467'></span>
Senator Borah affirmed at the time that it was utterly impossible to
imagine that the United States would calmly stand by.<a id='r18'/><a href='#f18' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[18]</span></sup></a> After the
discredit resulting from the failure of the policy of collective
security in the case of Manchuria and Abyssinia the world had come
to understand the now famous “quarantine” speech of President
Franklin D. Roosevelt on 5 October 1937 and his “Stop Hitler!”
warnings before and after Munich to mean that the United States
would act on the next occasion. The declaration of neutrality of
5 September 1939 could therefore only mean: Like Great Britain and
the Soviet Union, the United States accepts as a fact the collapse of
the system of collective security.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This declaration of neutrality has often been looked upon as the
death blow to the system. The Washington Government would be
entitled to reject such a reproach as unjustified. For the system had
already been dead for years, provided one is prepared to believe that
it was ever actually alive. But many did not realize the fact that
it was no longer alive until it was brought into relief by the
American declaration of neutrality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By 1 September 1939 the various experiments, which had been
tried since the first World War with a view to replace the “anarchic
world order” of classical international law by a better, a genuine,
order of peace, were over, that is, to create in the community of
states a general statute according to which there would be wars
which are forbidden by law and others which are countenanced.
These experiments, in the opinion of the major powers of the time,
had failed. The greatest military powers of the earth clashed in a
struggle in which they pitted their full strength against one another.
For the proponents of a materialistic conception of history this
meant the second phase in a process developing according to inexorable
laws, whereby history swept away all diplomatic and
juridical artifices with supreme indifference.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The majority of international lawyers throughout the world
maintained that in universal international law as at present applied,
there exists no distinction as to forbidden and nonforbidden wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hans Kelsen set this forth in 1942 in his paper <span class='it'>Law and Peace in
International Relations</span>, which he wrote after painstaking research
into literature. He himself belongs to the minority who are prepared
to concede a legal distinction between just and unjust wars, so that
his statement carries all the more weight.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now we must ask: Are we in point of fact right in speaking of
the collapse of the system of collective security? This would
<span class='pageno' title='468' id='Page_468'></span>
presuppose that such a system at one time existed. Can that really
be maintained? This is a question of the greatest importance for this
Trial, in which the existence of a world-wide consciousness of right
and wrong is taken as the basis for the indictment for breach of
the peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us recall the tragedy of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, that tragedy
from which all those have suffered so much who rejoiced when the
pact was concluded and who later, after a first period of depression,
hailed the Stimson Doctrine as a long overdue step essential for the
achievement of real peace and as an encouraging omen of fresh
progress.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States had a great goal in view in 1927 and 1928, as
I already mentioned. In the League of Nations the problem had been
tackled only half-heartedly and with half measures, and this had
perhaps done more harm than good to the cause of real peace. The
Geneva Protocol had failed. Kellogg now wanted to overcome all
the difficulties inherent in the problem and bring the world round
by vitality and determination. The pact as published, with its two
articles containing the renunciation of war and the obligation of
peaceful settlement, seemed to still the yearning of humanity eager
for some deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But the difficulties it was desired to surmount are in part rooted
in the problem, and no rules laid down by any legislator will ever
fully eliminate them. For even if unambiguous criteria existed, who
among fallible mankind would have the authority to give a decision
in case of dispute? We do not even possess unambiguous criteria for
aggression and defense.<a id='r19'/><a href='#f19' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[19]</span></sup></a> This holds good both for the so-called
political concept, which is in a way natural, and for the legal concept
or concepts of aggression and defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Yet these were not the only difficulties pointed out, explicitly
and implicitly, by the French Government in the preliminary
negotiations for the pact; they did so with the full title<a id='r20'/><a href='#f20' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[20]</span></sup></a> of one
who knows Europe and its ancient historical heritage just as the
United States Government knows America and its vastly different
history.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='469' id='Page_469'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>When the world came to know the notes exchanged during the
preliminary negotiations with all their definitions, interpretations,
qualifications, and reservations, it became manifest to what extent
the opinions of the governments differed behind that wording. One
saw the Soviet Government’s frank—even scathing—criticism of the
refusal of the Western Powers to disarm and thus create the
essential precondition for an effective policy of peace and generally
of the vagueness of the treaty;<a id='r21'/><a href='#f21' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[21]</span></sup></a> but especially of the famous British
reservation of a free hand in certain regions of the world, that
reservation which has often been called the British Monroe Doctrine
or the Chamberlain Doctrine;<a id='r22'/><a href='#f22' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[22]</span></sup></a> and one knew that in reality there
existed only formal agreement behind the signatures and that no
two powers were implying exactly the same thing by the treaty.
Only on one thing did complete agreement exist: War in self-defense
is permitted as an inalienable right to all states; without
that right, sovereignty does not exist; and every state is sole judge
of whether in a given case it is waging a war of self-defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No state in the world at that time was prepared to accept foreign
jurisdiction concerning the question of whether its decisions on basic
questions of its very existence were justified or not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Kellogg had declared to all the nine states participating in the
negotiations, in his note of 25 June 1928:<a id='r23'/><a href='#f23' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[23]</span></sup></a></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...The right of self-defense...is inherent in every sovereign
state and is implicit in every treaty. Every nation...is alone
competent to decide whether circumstances require recourse
to war in self-defense.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The friends of peace were cruelly disappointed. What was the
use of such a treaty anyway? They were only too right. Very soon
afterward they heard with even greater grief of the course of the
discussions in the American Senate. The ratification was, it is true,
passed with 85 votes against 1, with a few abstentions; but if,
behind the signatures of the contracting states there was no material
agreement, there was even less behind the result of the vote in the
Senate of that world power which was, as far as the conception and
initiative was concerned, the leading one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The discussions in the Senate, which will remain memorable for
all time because of their earnest and profound character, showed—and
several senators expressly said so—that the opinions of the
senators were oscillating between two poles which were worlds
apart. For some the treaty really meant a turning-point in world
<span class='pageno' title='470' id='Page_470'></span>
history; to others it appeared worthless, or at best a feeble or
friendly gesture, a popular slogan, a sort of international embrace;
to yet others as fertile soil for all the wars of the future, a gigantic
piece of hypocrisy, as the legalization of war or even of British
world control, or as a guarantee of the unjust <span class='it'>status quo</span> of Versailles
for France and Great Britain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Some senators criticized the utter vagueness of the stipulations
of the treaty even more bitterly than the Russian note. And if
Kellogg’s declaration about the right of self-defense, which, according
to the will of the signatory states, was an integral part of the
treaty, was taken literally: What kind of war was then forbidden?<a id='r24'/><a href='#f24' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[24]</span></sup></a>
Sarcastic and ironical words were used in the Senate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nothing was gained by this Paris Pact if everything were to
remain as at its conclusion. In the opinion of the great American
expert on international law, Philip Marshall Brown, the pact
unwittingly engendered by its ineptness the horrible specter of
“undeclared war.”<a id='r25'/><a href='#f25' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[25]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Those, Germans or non-Germans, who fought against Versailles
because progress was blocked, and those, Germans or non-Germans,
who criticized the League of Nations because it did more harm than
good to the will toward progress, had all rejoiced for nothing at the
end of August 1928. The decisive step had not been taken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But above all the one thing which, though not sufficient in itself,
is indispensable if a guarantee of peace is really to be created, the
one thing that is necessary in the unanimous opinion of all who
reckon with human frailty, was never tackled: To create a procedure
by which the community of states, even against the will of
the possessor, can change conditions that have become intolerable,
in order to provide life with the safety valve it must have if it is to
be spared an explosion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual state, if at all, can avoid revolutions only by good
legislation and an early adjustment of order to changing conditions;
and the same is true of the community of states. Wilson also had
this fundamental principle in mind, as we saw. One of the great
British experts on international law, one of the enthusiastic, unconditional,
and progressive adherents of the Paris Pact, McNair, took
this into account too when, in 1936, he wanted to see placed beside
collective force the collective and peaceful revision of conditions
which had become dangerous.<a id='r26'/><a href='#f26' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[26]</span></sup></a> And it was also taken into account
<span class='pageno' title='471' id='Page_471'></span>
by the American experts on international law, Borchard<a id='r27'/><a href='#f27' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[27]</span></sup></a> and
Fenwick,<a id='r28'/><a href='#f28' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[28]</span></sup></a> in their warning illustration of the situation as regards
international law shortly before the second World War. The Reich
Government, by the way, had pointed out this problem, which
overshadowed all others, in Stresemann’s note to the American
Ambassador, dated 27 April 1928, when unconditionally agreeing to
Kellogg’s proposal.<a id='r29'/><a href='#f29' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[29]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>Later, the problem of “collective revision” was never seriously
tackled. This is not surprising, if only because the very character
of such a procedure would presuppose renunciation of their sovereignty
by the states. And can such a renunciation be considered in
the times we live in? In Philip Brown’s melancholic opinion—“less
than ever.”<a id='r30'/><a href='#f30' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[30]</span></sup></a> For that reason a real forward step in the question
as to how war could legally be outlawed was impracticable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of these intricate complications the Government of the
United States and the League of Nations did a great deal to comply
with the urgent demands of the nations. They subsequently tried to
give the pact a precise content, and “teeth.” The doctrine of international
law provided suggestions for this and checked it. Although
it remained completely unsuccessful, we shall have to trace this
process briefly, because the seed for the ideas contained in the
Indictment are to be found here, insofar as its line of argument is
not a political or ethical but a legal one.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In its ban on aggression, the Paris Pact unquestionably starts
from the political concept of aggression. But that is quite indefinite.
Shotwell and Brierly, among others, tried to assist immediately by
deducing a legal concept of aggression from the second article of the
treaty, which establishes the obligation to follow a procedure of
peaceful settlement.<a id='r31'/><a href='#f31' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[31]</span></sup></a> We can leave open the question whether it
is permissible to apply this interpretation to the treaty. In practice
nothing is gained by doing so; one kind of difficulty is simply put in
the place of another. There are no fewer obscurities. Measures for
peaceful settlement presuppose good will on both sides; what if that
is lacking on one side or the other? And what still constitutes a
measure of peaceful settlement, and what no longer does? The
Russian Government were quite right in their note of 31 August
<span class='pageno' title='472' id='Page_472'></span>
1928 on the Kellogg-Briand Pact when they brought up this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Other attempts to help tried to develop a completely new world
constitution out of the entirely vague pact by way of logic. They are
connected with the name of the American Secretary of State, Stimson,
and with the work of the Budapest meeting of the International
Law Association in 1934.<a id='r32'/><a href='#f32' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[32]</span></sup></a> In order to understand this, it will be
found necessary to assume that the Kellogg Pact really did bring
about, in a legally conceivable manner, the unambiguous and unconditional
renunciation of war. Then, of course, there exists no longer
any right to wage wars as and when one likes. War waged in
defiance of this prohibition is an offense against the constitution of
the community of states. We are immediately faced by the question:
Can the legal position of a state which attacks contrary to law be
the same as that of a state which is being attacked contrary to law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one answers “no,” as does for instance the influential French
commentator of the League of Nations Covenant, Jean Ray,<a id='r33'/><a href='#f33' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[33]</span></sup></a> does
not this mean the elimination of the most important fundamental
principles of classic international law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Do the international laws of war—which, after all, spring
from the right to wage war freely and from the duel-like character
of war and certainly from the equality of the belligerents before
the law—apply for the qualification of the acts of the belligerent
powers against one another?</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Is it possible, or indeed permissible, that neutrality should
still exist in such a war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Can the result of the war, assuming that the aggressor is
victorious, be valid under law, especially when compressed into the
form of a treaty, or must not the community of states deprive the
aggressor of the spoils of his victory by a policy of nonrecognition?
Should there not be, or must there not be, joint coercive action by
the states against the aggressor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be noted that not even theoretical law has drawn all
possible conclusions. The practice of the states, after a few tentative
beginnings in isolated points, never came to a definite conclusion in
a single case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the first point, the validity of the international
laws of war during a war, whatever its origin, has never so far been
seriously disputed by any state. Any doubts that arose were cleared
up in a way which allowed of no misunderstandings. I draw attention
to Resolution Number 3 of the League of Nations Assembly
<span class='pageno' title='473' id='Page_473'></span>
of 4 October 1921 and to the report of the Committee of Eleven
of the League of Nations for the adaptation of the Covenant to the
Pact of Paris.<a id='r34'/><a href='#f34' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[34]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The aggressor state has the same rights and duties in a war as
the attacked nation, that is, those laid down by the traditional
international laws of war. The French chief prosecutor appears to
wish to deviate from this line, although he does not seem disposed
to draw the full conclusions. However, I do not see any tendency to
deviate from the present path even in the most recent practice of
states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the second point:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Attempts have been made to deny the obligation to remain
neutral and, in fact, finally to establish for the states not involved
the right of non neutrality and even the right to wage war against
the aggressor. Some statesmen and scholars have devoted themselves
just as passionately to undermining, and even to outlawing, the right
to neutrality as other statesmen and scholars have spoken in favor
of its undiminished continuance.<a id='r35'/><a href='#f35' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[35]</span></sup></a> The clearer it became that the
whole system of collective security failed to function in those particular
cases which were of decisive importance, namely, where steps
would have had to be taken against a great power, the more the
idea of neutrality asserted itself with fresh vigor. The complete
discredit attaching to the League of Nations and the system of the
Kellogg-Briand Pact since the Abyssinian conflict put classical
international law back into its old position. In 1935 Switzerland
declared her unrestricted neutrality;<a id='r36'/><a href='#f36' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[36]</span></sup></a> Belgium, Denmark, Finland,
Luxembourg, Norway, Holland, and Sweden followed with their
<span class='pageno' title='474' id='Page_474'></span>
declaration at Copenhagen on 24 July 1938.<a id='r37'/><a href='#f37' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[37]</span></sup></a> The failure of the
League of Nations was the reason quite openly given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With reference to the third point:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea underlying the policy of nonrecognition is that the
states not involved in a conflict should conduct themselves as
members of the community of states, that is, they should protect the
constitution of the community of states by refusing to recognize the
fruits of victory, should the victor have been the aggressor. The
situation he has created by force should not even seem to become
a legal situation. He will thus be deprived of what he has gained,
and one of the main inducements to wage war will thereby be
eliminated. Such a policy of nonrecognition is undoubtedly not
enough to guarantee by itself a system of collective security, but it
is an indispensable part of such an order. There can be no dispute
about this. The Brazilian representative, Senhor Braga, gained merit
by proposing, at the second League Assembly in 1921, that such a
policy be followed by the members of the League of Nations under
the name of a “universal legal blockade” (<span class='it'>blocus juridique universel</span>).<a id='r38'/><a href='#f38' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[38]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Finnish representative, M. Procope, interpreted Article 10 of
the Covenant in this sense in 1930 before the League Assembly.<a id='r39'/><a href='#f39' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[39]</span></sup></a>
The notes by the American Secretary of State, Stimson, of 7 January
1932 to China and Japan<a id='r40'/><a href='#f40' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[40]</span></sup></a> made this idea echo throughout the world.
Their contents are commonly referred to as the Stimson Doctrine.
The League of Nations accepted the Doctrine as a resolution of the
Assembly on 11 March 1932.<a id='r41'/><a href='#f41' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[41]</span></sup></a> The concept was later the focal point
of the Pact of Rio de Janeiro of 10 October 1933 and of the Budapest
Articles of 10 September 1934.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia in 1935-36 became the
great test case,<a id='r42'/><a href='#f42' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[42]</span></sup></a> which decided the fate of the system of collective
security. The League of Nations declared a member, which was a
great power, to be the aggressor and decreed economic sanctions but
then shrank from coercive military measures and finally, after
Italy’s victory, struggled painfully in debates on procedure, especially
at the 18th Assembly of the League, to find an answer to the
<span class='pageno' title='475' id='Page_475'></span>
question as to how the League, without openly betraying its constitution,
could cross the attacked member, the minor power of Abyssinia,
off the list of existing states and recognize it as part of the
Italian Empire. The United States, too, did not enforce the Stimson
Doctrine but remained strictly neutral.<a id='r43'/><a href='#f43' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[43]</span></sup></a>,<a id='r44'/><a href='#f44' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[44]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>It is necessary to realize all this; and also to know that the
British Government, on 20 February 1935, politely but firmly
refused, through Lord Chancellor Viscount Sankey,<a id='r45'/><a href='#f45' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[45]</span></sup></a> to accept the
logical explications and paid tribute to the old truth: “It is not logic
but history that creates law.”<a id='r46'/><a href='#f46' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[46]</span></sup></a> On a later occasion, when Secretary
of State Cordell Hull had explained the principle of American policy
to all the powers on 16 July 1937,<a id='r47'/><a href='#f47' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[47]</span></sup></a> the Portuguese Government
issued a warning against “the abstract and generalizing tendency of
jurists”; it warned against attempts to “find a single formula” and
against not studying historic facts sufficiently.<a id='r48'/><a href='#f48' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[48]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>We therefore come to the conclusion that in the actual relations
between states there existed—quite a number of years prior to
1939—no effective general ruling of international law regarding
prohibited war. No such general ruling existed so far as the leading
statesmen and the peoples were aware.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is, in fact, the ultimate reason why the system of specific
rulings on international law was followed to an ever-increasing
extent. Two states would thus conclude treaties, in full knowledge
of their particular historical conditions and with a view to guarantee
peace between each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, during the second World War the United States Government
decided to help Great Britain. Great Britain was able to
acquire destroyers, and it later received the assistance of Lend-Lease.
The American public recognized this act of assistance as
<span class='pageno' title='476' id='Page_476'></span>
being essentially no longer neutral; it was regretted by some, welcomed
by others, sometimes attacked and sometimes defended. The
supporters of the measures before the American public, above all
Stimson and Cordell Hull, quite rightly refrained from justifying
them as consistent with neutrality. On the contrary, they took their
stand on the Pact of Paris as interpreted by the Budapest Articles.<a id='r49'/><a href='#f49' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[49]</span></sup></a>
As we saw, this would, according to Viscount Sankey’s indisputably
correct conception of the sources of international law, have been
wrong as far back as 1935.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the developments which had taken place since Italy’s
victory over Abyssinia, such discussions were entirely outside the
field of legal realities. Their purpose was to resolve internal dissensions
in America and for that very reason could not have been
of direct importance for international law. Even had these discussions
taken place between states, they could at most have helped to
create law. But is it actually necessary to assert or prove that such
discussions could not have created, in the midst of the great struggle,
a law to attain which so many efforts—efforts which were proved to
have been Utopian—were made in vain in peacetime?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this Court many ways of legal thinking meet—ways which
are in part very different. This leads to a number of ineradicable
differences of opinion. But no manner of legal thinking anywhere
on earth, from the most ancient times to the most recent, could or
can make possible arguments which contradict the very nature of
law as a social order of human life arising out of history. If several
governments accept articles about whose contents they are of
different opinions and if these articles then find no real application
in the practice of these governments—which is not to be wondered
at considering the circumstances under which they arose—and if
logicians then interpret these articles, while the practice of governments
rejects these interpretations either expressly or tacitly, then
one will simply have to resign oneself to this, inasmuch as one
proposes to keep to the task of legal appreciation, however much
the goal may seem worth striving for, politically or morally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But let us forget for a moment the bitter realities of those years
following upon the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Let us suppose for a
moment that a general and unambiguous pact had existed, accepted
and applied by the contracting parties in fundamental and factual
agreement. Would the liability of individuals to punishment for the
breach of such a treaty be founded in international law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No—not even the liability of the state to punishment, let alone
that of individuals.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='477' id='Page_477'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The breach of such a treaty would not be any different, under
existing international law, from any other violation of international
law. The state violating a treaty would be committing an offense
against international law, but not a punishable act.<a id='r50'/><a href='#f50' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[50]</span></sup></a> Attempts were
occasionally made to deduce from words <span class='it'>délit</span> (offense), <span class='it'>crime international</span>
(international crime), and <span class='it'>condamnation de la guerre</span> (condemnation
of war) the existence of an international criminal law
dealing with our case. Such conclusions are based on wrong
premises.<a id='r51'/><a href='#f51' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[51]</span></sup></a> Every lawyer knows that any unlawful behavior can be
called a <span class='it'>délit</span> (<span class='it'>delictum</span>), not only punishable behavior. And the
word <span class='it'>crime</span> is used even entirely outside the legal sphere. And this
is precisely the case here. When in 1927, on Poland’s application,
the League of Nations Assembly declared war to be a <span class='it'>crime international</span>,
the Polish representative expressly stated that the declaration
was not actually a legal instrument but an act of moral and
educational importance.<a id='r52'/><a href='#f52' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[52]</span></sup></a> The endeavor to organize a universal
world system of collective security on a legal basis failed. But this
does not mean that the numerous bilateral treaties whose purpose
it is to preclude wars of aggression between the two partners became
inapplicable. One will have to examine whether the parties to the
treaty may have made the existence or continued existence of a
general machinery of collective security the prerequisite for the
validity of the treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For unilateral assurances of nonaggression the same holds good
as for bilateral treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Many bilateral nonaggression pacts were concluded and several
unilateral assurances were given. In some cases a political, in others
a legal concept of aggression, or even a number of such legal concepts
may determine right and wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich also concluded a series of such pacts. They have been
cited by the Prosecution in argument. One must examine whether
all these treaties were still in force at the critical moment, and this
examination will be left to the individual defendant’s counsel. But
if the Reich did attack, in some specific case, in breach of a nonaggression
pact which was still valid, it committed an offense in
international law and is responsible therefor according to the rules
of international law regarding such offenses.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='478' id='Page_478'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But only the Reich—not the individual, even if he were the head
of the State. This is beyond all doubt, according to existing international
law. It is unnecessary even to speak about this. For up to
the most recent times not even the possibility was mentioned, either
in the Manchurian, or in the Italo-Abyssinian, or in the Russo-Finnish
conflict, of instituting criminal proceedings against those
people who were responsible, on the Japanese, Italian, or Russian
side, for planning, preparing, launching, and conducting the war,
or who simply participated in these acts in any way. And it was
certainly not because matters had, paradoxically enough, not been
thought out to the end, that they were not prosecuted. They were
not prosecuted because this cannot take place as long as the sovereignty
of states is the organizational basic principle of interstate
order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think this would be a convenient time to
break off.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. JAHRREISS: One thing or another<a id='r53'/><a href='#f53' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[53]</span></sup></a>—should things reach
the point where, according to general world law, the men who
participated in the planning, preparation, launching, and conduct
of a war forbidden by international law could be brought before an
international criminal court, the decisions regarding the state’s final
problems of existence would be subject to super-state control. One
might, of course, still term such states sovereign; but they would no
longer be sovereign. In his paper, written late in 1943, which I have
already mentioned several times and which was prepared after the
Moscow conference of 1 November 1943, Kelsen again and again
repeats that in questions of breach of the peace, the liability of
individuals to punishment does not exist according to the general
international law at present valid and that it cannot exist because
of the concept of sovereignty.<a id='r54'/><a href='#f54' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[54]</span></sup></a></p>

<p class='pindent'>For Europeans, at any rate, the state has during the last four
centuries, especially following the pronounced advance made by the
idea of the national state, achieved the dignity of a super-person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of course, acts of state are acts of men. Yet they are in fact acts
of state, that is, acts of the state carried out by its organs and not
the private acts of Mr. Smith or Mr. Müller.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the Prosecution is doing when, in the name of the world
community as a legal entity, it desires to have individuals legally
<span class='pageno' title='479' id='Page_479'></span>
sentenced for their decisions regarding war and peace, is, when
facing the issue from the angle of European history, to look upon
the state as one would look upon a private individual; indeed, more
than that: What it is doing is destroying the spirit of the state. Such
an indictment, the moral justification of which is not my concern—such
an indictment is, as we have already shown, incompatible with
the very nature of sovereignty and with the feeling of the majority
of Europeans. It seems, indeed, as though not only Europeans feel
that way. In 1919, in Paris, it was the American delegates at the
War Guilt Investigation Committee who opposed most strongly any
legal sentence on the Kaiser for the very reason of the incompatibility
of such a procedure with the sovereignty of the State.<a id='r55'/><a href='#f55' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[55]</span></sup></a> And
it is impossible to underline the idea of sovereignty more strongly
than Kellogg did 8 years later during the negotiations in connection
with the Pact of Paris, when he declared, as I have already said,
“Every state is the sole judge of its behavior with regard to
questions affecting its very existence.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>There are epochs which idolize the sovereignty of the state;
others deprecate it. Certain epochs have done both at the same
time—ours does so. Perhaps we are living in a period of transition.
Perhaps a transformation of values is taking place. Perhaps world
community will become the supreme political value for the peoples
in place of their own particular states, which, at any rate, held this
position hitherto. Perhaps we shall reach a point where the
unleashing of a war deserving moral and also legal condemnation
will, for the general legal conscience, constitute high treason against
the world community. Perhaps we shall reach a point where it will
be permissible, or even compulsory, to betray a government starting
such a war to foreign countries without this being termed high
treason toward one’s own. At the moment there is in no nation a
majority, let alone unanimity, in support of this conclusion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The punishment of individuals by the legal community of nations
for breach of the peace between states can thus be ordered only
provided the fundamental principles of international law as at
present valid and the scale of values as for centuries they have been
firmly rooted in the feeling of the European nations are abandoned—that
scale of values according to which the state, one’s own sovereign
state, forms the indispensable foundation for free personality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution breaks up in its own mind the German State
at a time when it stood upright in its full strength and acted through
<span class='pageno' title='480' id='Page_480'></span>
its organs. It must do so if it desires to prosecute individual persons
for a breach of the peace between states. It must turn the defendants
into private individuals. Then again the defendants—as it were,
on the private level—are strung together into a conspiracy by legal
concepts rooted in Anglo-Saxon law and alien to us. They are
placed on a pedestal provided by the many millions of members of
organizations and groups which are designated as criminal, thereby
once more allowing them to appear as an “ultra-individual” value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Insofar as the Charter supports all this by its regulations, it is
laying down fundamentally new law, if—concurring with the British
chief prosecutor—one measures against existing international law.
That which, originating in Europe, has finally spread to the whole
world and is called international law is, in essence, a law of the
co-ordination of sovereign states. Measuring the regulations of the
Charter against this law, we shall have to say: The regulations of
the Charter deny the basis of this law; they anticipate the law of a
world state. They are revolutionary. Perhaps, in the hopes and
yearnings of the nations, the future is theirs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A lawyer, and only as such may I speak here, will merely have
to establish that they are new—revolutionarily new. The laws
regarding war and peace between states provided no room for them
and could not do so. Thus they are criminal laws with retroactive
force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now the French chief prosecutor—if I understand correctly—recognized
the sovereignty of states in his profoundly moving speech
and quite rightly saw that an unbridgeable gulf exists between the
Charter and existing international law where it desires to see individuals
punished as criminals for breach of international peace. He
therefore transposes the Trial from the plane of international law
to that of constitutional law. It might have happened that a German
State would have settled accounts after the war with those people
who were responsible for launching the war. Since the whole life of
the German people is paralyzed today, those foreign powers, who
jointly on the basis of treaties have territorial power in Germany,
are undertaking this settlement of accounts. The Charter has laid
down the rules which are to guide the Court in its investigation and
verdict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>We can leave the question open as to whether this concept is
legally right or not. Even if it is right, our question is not modified
thereby. When looking at the problem from this point of view, no
differently from that of international law, we must know how far
the Charter creates penal law with retroactive force. But we must
now measure the regulations of the Charter not only against the
international law which was valid for Germany and was recast into
national law, as we say, but also against that national criminal
<span class='pageno' title='481' id='Page_481'></span>
law which was binding on the defendants at the time of the deed.
It is, after all, quite possible for a state, a member of the community
of states, to be more cosmopolitan in its criminal law than actual
international law. Some rule of the Charter, although new with
regard to existing international law, may correspond to an already
existing national law, so that it would not constitute criminal law
with retroactive force. So how was the breach of peace between
states—particularly the breach of nonaggression pacts—treated in
that national criminal law to which the defendants were subject
at the time of the preparation and launching of the war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible that in some state those people might be threatened
with punishment who prepared or launched or waged a war in
opposition to the international obligations of that state.<a id='r56'/><a href='#f56' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56]</span></sup></a> That
would, it is true, be completely impractical, for the result of a war
determines the internal settlement of accounts. No criminal court
will threaten a victorious government, whereas, in case of defeat,
the defeat itself provides the measure for such settlement. In any
case the regulations of the Charter regarding punishment for breach
of the peace between states are novel for the national criminal law
to which the defendants were subject at the time of the deed. If one
is not prepared to understand the phrase <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege
praevia</span> as it is understood on the European continent, that is, as
meaning that law in the sense of <span class='it'>lex</span> is a rule laid down by the
state, a state law, but holds the opinion which—as far as I can see—is
peculiar to English legal thinkers, that law in the sense of lex
can also be a deeply rooted rule of ethics or morality, then we still
have one question left: As things happened to be, did the defendants—formerly
ministers, military leaders, directors of economy,
heads of higher authorities—at the time of the deed feel, or could
they even have felt that a behavior which is now made punishable
by a retroactive law was originally in violation of their duty? The
answer to this question cannot be given without insight into the
nature of the constitution of the German Reich at the moment of
the deed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German Reich was incorporated into the community of
states in the form and with the constitution which it happened to
have at any given moment. Such is the case with every member of
the community of states. The United States and the British Empire,
the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the French Republic,
Brazil and Switzerland, stand in the framework of the family of
nations with such a constitution as they happen to have at the time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution, with full justification, has tried to convey a
picture of this concrete legal structure of the Reich. Without trying
<span class='pageno' title='482' id='Page_482'></span>
to obtain such a picture, no one in this Trial will be able to arrive
at a decision regarding right and wrong. In addition it seems to
me that many ethical questions which have been raised here require
such an endeavor to be made. However, I am afraid that with the
picture presented by the Prosecution one will not come as close to
the truth as is possible, notwithstanding the complex nature of the
subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution is based upon the conception of a conspiracy to
conquer the world on the part of a few dozen criminals. The German
State, if one looks upon things in this way, becomes a mere
shadow or tool. But this State had long been in existence; no one
could set aside the enormous weight of its history. A number of
facts in its history, domestic and especially foreign, accounted for
Hitler’s rise to power or facilitated it for him, while there were
other things in this history that guided, urged, limited, or restrained
Hitler in his choice of aims and means, and helped to decide the
success or failure of his measures and undertakings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution was certainly right in laying great stress on the
so-called Führer Principle. This Führer Principle has, in fact, for
the eyes and even more for the ears of the German people and of
the world in general, been the organizational guiding principle in
the development of the Reich constitution after 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has never been unambiguous, and it considerably changed in
character during the course of the years. In human life leading and
dominating present inherent contradictions. There exists one, as it
were, soulless, mechanical way of directing mankind, which is to
dominate, to rule by issuing commands; and there is another one,
which is to precede by setting an example and being followed voluntarily,
which is to lead or whatever one wishes to call it. This
differentiation between two fundamentally different methods of
directing men is often already complicated by the words used; in
the German language, for instance this is so because “leading” is
sometimes substituted for unconscious domination, while domination
is occasionally called leading. The differentiation is rendered even
more difficult by the fact that leading may alternate with domination
in relations between the same persons or by the fact that methods
which are actually applicable to leading are used in dominating
and vice versa. Every state has been, is, and will be, faced by the
question of how it is to link up both these methods, so that they
may complement, promote, and keep a check on each other. Both
methods appear continually and everywhere. There has never yet
been a truly dominating ruler who was not also a leader, although
minor rulers are also subject to this law. And the Hitler regime
did bring about—at least to begin with—a synthesis of both methods
which had at least the appearance of being tremendously efficient.
<span class='pageno' title='483' id='Page_483'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>To this synthesis has been attributed—perhaps not unjustly—much
of what the world registered with wonder, sometimes approvingly,
but more often disapprovingly, as the result of an unheard-of
mobilization, concentration, and increase in the energies of a
nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This remarkable synthesis of leading and dominating found its
maximum expression in the person of Hitler himself, in his acts
of leadership, for instance, in his speeches, and in his commands.
Hitler’s acts of leadership and commanding became the motive
power of the German political life of that time. Above all, this
phenomenon must be taken into correct account. It is of absolutely
decisive importance in judging the enormous mass of facts which
has been produced here. With all due caution, which is natural to
men accustomed to think along scientific lines and imbues them with
an almost unconquerable mistrust of any attempt to comprehend and
evaluate events which have happened so recently, one is perhaps
entitled to vouchsafe this assertion: In the course of the years
Hitler accorded the act of command an increasingly favored place
to the detriment of acts of leadership and finally brought it so much
to the fore that commands, not the act of leadership, became the
all-decisive factor. Hitler, the man of the people, became more and
more the dictator. The speeches in which he repeated himself ad
nauseam, even for his most willing followers, and shrieked out, to
the irritation even of the most faithful disciples, became rarer,
while the legislative machine worked faster and faster. A later age
will perhaps realize to what extent the great change in the attitude
of the German people toward Hitler, which was beginning to show
even before the war, was the cause or effect of this modification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereas on a superficial question, that is, the question as to
how he wished to be designated, Hitler urged not to be called
“Führer and Reich Chancellor” any longer, but only “Führer,” the
way in which the State was being governed was taking the exactly
opposite path; leadership disappeared more and more, and there
remained naked domination. The Führer’s orders became the
central element of the German state edifice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the public hierarchy, this development was attended by an
increase rather than a decrease in Hitler’s power. The great
majority of German civil servants and officers had seen nothing
behind the organized leadership but a machinery of domination
invested with a new label and, if possible, an even more bureaucratic
nature functioning side by side with the inherited state
machinery. When Hitler’s orders became the Alpha and Omega,
they felt themselves, so to speak, returned to the old familiar path.
The queer and puzzling apparition had gone.
<span class='pageno' title='484' id='Page_484'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>They were back in their world of subordination. Nevertheless,
this development had given the Führer’s orders a special aura of
sanctity for them too; there was no contradicting the Führer’s
orders. One could perhaps raise objections; but if the Führer abided
by his order, the matter was decided. His orders were something
quite different from the orders of any official within the hierarchy
under him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here we have the fundamental question in this Trial: What
position did Hitler’s orders occupy in the general order of Germany?
Did they belong to the type of orders which were disallowed by the
Charter of this Court as grounds for the exclusion of punishment?</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was perhaps harder for a lawyer who grew up in the habits
of the state founded on law than for other people to witness the
slow and then ever more rapid disintegration of that foundation of
law supporting the state; he never came to feel at home in the new
order and always remained half outside. Yet for that very reason
he probably knows better than anyone else the peculiarities of this
new order, and he may attempt to make them comprehensible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>State orders, whether they lay down law or decide individual
cases, can always be measured not only against the existing written
and unwritten law of the state concerned but also against the rules
of international law, morality, and religion. Someone, even if only
the conscience of the person giving the orders, will always ask
whether the person giving the order did not perhaps order something
which he had no right to order or whether he may not have formed
and published his order by an inadmissible procedure. Now an
unavoidable problem for all domination lies in this: Should or can
it grant the members of its hierarchy, its civil servants and officers,
the right—or even impose on them the duty—to examine at any
time any order which demands obedience from them, to determine
whether it is lawful and to decide accordingly whether to obey or
refuse?</p>

<p class='pindent'>No form of rule which has appeared in history so far has given
an affirmative answer to this question. Only certain members of the
hierarchy were ever granted this right, and they were not granted
it without limits. Such was the case, for instance, under the
extremely democratic constitution of the German Reich during the
Weimar Republic, and it is again the case today under the occupation
rule of the four great powers over Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Insofar as no such right of examination is granted to members
of the hierarchy, orders are binding upon them. All constitutional
law, including that of modern states, provides for acts of state which
must be respected by the authorities, even when defective. Certain
acts constituting rules, certain decisions on individual cases which
have acquired legal force, are held to be valid even when the person
<span class='pageno' title='485' id='Page_485'></span>
giving the order has exceeded his competency or made a mistake
in form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If only because the process of referring to a still superior order
finally comes to an end, there must under every government exist
orders that are binding on the members of the hierarchy under all
circumstances, and therefore represent law to the officials concerned,
even though outsiders may find that they are defective as regards
content or form when measured against the previous laws of the
state concerned or against rules applying outside the state. For
instance, in direct democracies, an order given as the result of a
plebiscite of the nation is a fully valid rule or an absolutely binding
decree. Rousseau knew how much the <span class='it'>volonté de tous</span> can be in
contradiction to what is right, but he did not fail to appreciate that
orders by <span class='it'>volonté de tous</span> are binding.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In indirect democracies the resolutions of a congress, a national
assembly, or a parliament may have the same force.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the partly direct, partly indirect democracy of the Weimar
Constitution of the German Reich the laws resolved by a majority
of the Reichstag large enough to modify the constitution and duly
promulgated under all circumstances were binding upon all functionaries,
including the independent courts of law, even though the
legislator—willingly or unwillingly—might have violated rules not
imposed by the state but by the Church or by the community of
states. In the latter case the Reich would have been guilty of an
international offense, since it would have failed to see to it that its
legislation was in accordance with international law. It would,
therefore, have been responsible under the international regulations
regarding reparation for international offenses. But until the law
concerned had been eliminated in accordance with the rules of
German constitutional law, all officials of the hierarchy would have
had to obey it. No functionary would have had the right, let alone
the duty, to examine its legally binding nature with the aim of
obeying or refusing to obey it, depending on the result of this
examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Things are no different in any other state in the world. It never
has been and never can be different. Every state has had the
experience of seeing its ultimate orders, its supreme orders, which
must be binding on the hierarchy if the authority of the state is to
subsist at all, on occasion coming into conflict with rules not imposed
by the state—to divine law, to natural law, and to the laws of
reason. Good governments take pains to avoid such conflicts. To
the great sorrow—indeed, to the despair—of many Germans, Hitler
frequently brought about such conflicts. If only for this reason, his
way of governing was not a good one, even though it was for several
years successful in some spheres.
<span class='pageno' title='486' id='Page_486'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One thing however must be said straight away: these conflicts
never affected the entire nation or the entire hierarchy—at least not
immediately—but always merely groups of the nation or individual
offices of the hierarchy. It was only some of the people concerned
who were fundamentally affected, the bulk being only superficially
involved—not to mention those conflicts that remained unknown to
the overwhelming majority of the people and of the hierarchy, those
orders, therefore, by which Hitler not only showed himself to be
inhuman in individual instances but simply put himself outside the
pale of what is human. Here is a purely academic question: Would
Hitler’s power have taken such deep root, would it have maintained
itself, if these inhumanities had become known to wider sections of
the people and of the hierarchy? There can be no answer: they
did not.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now in a state in which the entire power to make final decisions
is concentrated in the hands of a single individual, the orders of
this one man are absolutely binding on the members of the
hierarchy. This individual is their sovereign, their <span class='it'>legibus solutus</span>,
as was first formulated—as far as I can see—by French political
science with as much logic as eloquence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all, the world is not faced by such a phenomenon for the
first time. In former times it may even have appeared to be normal.
In the modern world, a world of constitutions based on the separation
of powers under the supervision of the people, absolute
monocracy does not seem to be proper in principle. And though this
may not yet be the case today, one day the world will know that
the vast majority of intelligent Germans did not think any differently
on this matter from the majority of intelligent people of other
nations in and outside Europe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such absolutely monocratic constitutions can nevertheless come
about as the result of events which no individual can grasp in their
entirety, much less control at will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This is what happened in Germany from the beginning of 1933
onward. This is what happened gradually, stage by stage, to the
parliamentary Weimar Republic, which under Hindenburg was
changed into a presidential republic, in a process which partly
furthered the development by acts of state which stressed legal
forms and which can be read in state documents, but partly
simply formed the rules by accepted custom. The Reich law of
24 March 1933, by which the institution of Reich Government Laws
was created, whereby the separation of powers in the sense in
which it had been customary was, in practice, eliminated, was,
according to the transcript of the Reichstag session, passed with
a majority sufficient for altering the constitution. Doubts about
the legality of the law have nevertheless been raised on the grounds
<span class='pageno' title='487' id='Page_487'></span>
that a section of the deputies elected had been prevented from
attending the session by the police, while another section of
the deputies who were present had been intimidated, so that only
an apparent majority sufficient for altering the constitution had
passed the law. It has even been said that no Reichstag, not even if
everybody had been present and all of them had voted, could have
abolished the fundamental constitutional principle of the separation
of powers, since no constitution could legalize its suicide. We need
not go into this. The institution of government laws became so
firmly rooted as a result of undisputed practice that only a formal
jurisprudence entirely cut off from the realities of life could have
attempted to play off paragraphs against life and to ignore the
constitutional change which had taken place. And for the same
reason one’s arguments are faulty if one chooses to ignore how the
institution of government laws, that is, cabinet law, was later
changed by custom into one of several forms in which the Führer
legislated. At the base of every state order, as of any order whatsoever,
there lie habit and custom. From the time when Hitler
became head of the State, practice quickly resulted in Hitler heading
both the hierarchy and the whole people as the undisputed and
indisputable possessor of all competency. The result of the development
was, at any rate, that Hitler became the supreme legislator as
well as the supreme author of individual orders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He gained this position to some extent under the impression of
the surprising successes—or what were considered successes—in
Germany and abroad, especially during the course of the past war.
Perhaps the German people, although with great differences between
North and South, West and East, particularly easily falls a prey to
actual power, particularly easily obeys by orders, particularly well
conforms to the idea of a superior. Thus the whole process may
have been rendered easier.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, the only thing that was not quite clear was Hitler’s
relationship to the judiciary. For, even in Hitler Germany, it was
not possible to exterminate the idea that it was essential to allow
justice to be exercised by independent courts, at least in matters
which concern the bulk of the people in their everyday life. Up to
the top group of Party officials—this was shown by some of the
speeches by the Reich Leader of jurists, the Defendant Dr. Frank,
as quoted here—there showed resistance, which, it is true, was not
very effective, when justice in civil and ordinary criminal cases was
equally to be subjected to the <span class='it'>sic volo sic jubeo</span> of one man. But
apart from the judiciary, which in the end also was beginning to
succumb, absolute monocracy was complete. The Reichstag’s pompous
declaration about Hitler’s legal position, dated 26 April 1942,<a id='r56a'/><a href='#f56a' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[56a]</span></sup></a>
<span class='pageno' title='488' id='Page_488'></span>
was actually only the statement of what had become a fact long
before. The Führer’s orders constituted law already a considerable
time before this second World War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this state order the German Reich was treated as a partner by
the other states, throughout the whole field of politics. In this connection
I do not wish to stress the form—so impressive to the German
people and so fatal to all opposition—which this treatment took
in 1936 at the Olympic Games, a show which Hitler could not order
the delegations of foreign nations to attend, as he ordered Germans
to the Nuremberg Party Rally with its state displays. Rather would
I wish to point out that the governments of the greatest nations in
the world considered the word of this “all-powerful” man to be the
final decision, incontestably valid for every German, and based their
decisions on major questions on the very fact that Hitler’s order
was incontestable. To mention only the most striking cases, this
fact was relied upon when the British Prime Minister, Mr. Neville
Chamberlain, after the Munich Conference, displayed the famous
peace paper when he landed at Croydon. This fact was pointed to
when people went to war against the Reich as the barbaric despotism
of this one man.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No political system has yet pleased all people who live under it
or who feel its effects abroad. The German political system in the
Hitler era displeased a particularly large and ever-increasing number
of people at home and abroad. But that does not in any way
alter the fact that it existed. Its existence was in part due to the
recognition from abroad and to its effectiveness, which caused a
British Prime Minister to make the now world-famous statement at
a critical period, that democracies need two years longer than
totalitarian governments to attain a certain goal. Only one who has
lived in the outer cold and as though outcast among his own people
amidst blindly believing masses, who idolized this man as infallible,
can tell how firmly Hitler’s power was anchored in the nameless and
numberless following who held him capable of doing only what was
good and right. They did not know him personally; he was for them
what propaganda made of him, and this he was so uncompromisingly
that everybody who saw him from close range and summed him up
differently clearly realized that opposition was utterly pointless and,
in the eyes of other people, did not even represent martyrdom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Would it therefore not be a self-contradictory process if both the
following assertions were to be applied at the same time in the rules
governing this Trial? First, the Reich was the expression of the
despotism of this one man and for that very reason a danger to the
world. Secondly, every functionary had the right—in fact the
duty—to examine the orders of this man and to obey or not obey
them, according to the result of this examination.
<span class='pageno' title='489' id='Page_489'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The functionaries had neither the right nor the duty to examine
the orders of the monocrat to determine their legality. For them
these orders could never be illegal at all, with a single exception
which will be discussed later—an exception which, when carefully
examined, will be seen to be only an apparent one—namely, with
the exception of those cases in which the monocrat placed himself,
according to the indisputable axioms of our times, outside every
human order and in which a genuine question of right or wrong did
not arise, so that no genuine examination was called for, either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s will was the final authority for their considerations on
what to do and what not to do. The Führer’s order cut off every
discussion. Thus a person who as a functionary of the hierarchy
invokes an order by the Führer is not trying to claim exemption
from punishment for an illegal action but opposes the assertion that
his conduct was illegal; for it is his contention that the order with
which he complied was legally unassailable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a person with full comprehension of this can have a conception
of the hard inner struggles which so many German officials
had to fight out in these years in the face of many a decree or
resolution of Hitler’s. For them such cases were not a question or a
conflict between right and wrong; disputes about legality sank into
insignificance. For them the problem was one of legitimacy; as time
went on, human and divine law opposed each other ever more
strongly and frequently.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whatever the Charter means by the orders which it rejects as
grounds for exemption from punishment, can this be meant to apply
to the Führer’s orders? Can they come within the meaning of this
rule? Must one not accept this order for what it was according to
the interior German constitution as it had grown, a constitution
explicitly or implicitly recognized by the community of states? Many
Germans disapproved of Hitler’s position of power from the very
beginning; and to many Germans, who welcomed it at first because
they yearned for clear and quick decisions, it later became repugnant.
But that in no way affects the following: Must not those
people who did their duty in the hierarchy, willingly or unwillingly,
in accordance with the constitution, feel that an injustice is being
done to them if they were sentenced because of a deed or an
omission which was ordered by the Führer?</p>

<p class='pindent'>A community of states might refuse to accept or tolerate as
members such states as have a despotic constitution. Yet up to now
this has never been the case. If it is to be different in the future, the
nondespotic powers must take the necessary steps to prevent any
member of the family of states turning into a despotic power and to
prevent any despotic power from entering the family circle from
outside. Today people are realizing more and more clearly that this
<span class='pageno' title='490' id='Page_490'></span>
is the crux of our question. The circumstances must be very special
ones if a modern people is to let itself be governed despotically, even
when as well-disciplined as the German people. But wherever such
circumstances do exist, no domestic countermeasures are of avail.
In that eventuality only the outside world can help. If, instead, the
outside world prefers to recognize this constitution, it is impossible
to see where successful domestic resistance can spring from. In
pointing to these special circumstances and to the recognition by the
outside world, we are drawing attention to facts for the existence
of which, to take our case, no German was responsible but which
cannot be ignored when the question is asked how all this was
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Attention must also be drawn to certain further facts without
knowledge of which one cannot fully grasp the fact that Hitler’s
absolute monocracy was able to establish such a terribly firm hold.
Hitler combined in his person all the powers of issuing legislative
and administrative orders of a supreme character, orders which
could not be questioned and were absolutely valid; but immediately
below him the power of the state was divided up into a vast mass
of spheres of competence. The dividing lines between these spheres,
however, were not always sharply drawn. In a modern state, particularly
in major states of our technical era, this cannot be avoided.
The tendency to exaggerate questions of competency is certainly no
less marked in Germany than in any other country. This certainly
facilitated the erection of barriers between the departments. Every
department was jealously watching to see that no other trespassed
into its field. Everywhere it was prepared for tendencies of other
departments toward expansion. Considering the great mass of
tasks which the so-called “totalitarian” state had heaped upon itself,
cases where two or three departments were competent for the same
matter could not be avoided. Conflicts between departments were
inevitable. If a conspiracy existed, as the Indictment assumes, the
conspirators were remarkably incompetent organizers. Instead of
co-operating and going through thick and thin together, they fought
one another. Instead of a conspiracy we would seem to have had
more of a “dispiracy.” The history of the jealousy and mistrust
among the powerful figures under Hitler has still to be written. Now
let us remember that in the relations between all departments and
within each department, people surrounded themselves with ever-increasing
secrecy; between departments and within each department,
between ranks and within the various ranks, more and more
matters were classed as “secret.” Never before has there been so
much “public life,” that is, nonprivate life in Germany as under
Hitler; and also never before was public life so screened off from
the people, particularly from the individual members of the
hierarchy themselves, as under Hitler.
<span class='pageno' title='491' id='Page_491'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The single supreme will became, quite simply, technically indispensable.
It became the mechanical connecting link for the whole.
A functionary who met with objections or even resistance to one of
his orders on the part of other functionaries only needed to refer to
an order by the Führer to get his way. For this reason many, very
many, among those Germans who felt Hitler’s regime to be
intolerable, who indeed hated him like the devil, looked ahead only
with the greatest anxiety to the time when this man would disappear
from the scene. For what would happen when this connecting link
disappeared? It was a vicious circle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I again stress the fact that an order by the Führer was binding—and
indeed legally binding—on the person to whom it was given,
even if the directive was contrary to international law or to other
traditional values.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But was there really no limit? During the first period, at any
rate, that is, just at the time when the foundations of power were
being laid, at the time when the monocratic constitution was being
developed step by step, Hitler’s followers among the people saw
in their Führer a man close to the people, an unselfish, almost
superhumanly intuitive and clear-thinking pilot and believed only
the best of him; they had only one worry: Was he also choosing
the right men for his assistants, and was he always aware of what
they were doing? The tremendous power, the unlimited authority
were vested in this Hitler. As in every state, this might include
harsh orders. But it was never intended as giving full power to be
inhuman. Here lies the boundary line; but this line has at no time
and nowhere been quite clearly drawn. Today the German people
are utterly torn in their opinions, feelings, and intentions; but they
are probably in agreement on one thing, with very few exceptions:
As accusers, they would not wish to draw this line with less severity
than other people do toward their leaders. Beyond that line, Hitler’s
order constituted no legal justification.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must not be forgotten, however, that this line is not only vague
by nature but also follows a different course in peace than in
wartime, when so many values are changed and when men of all
nations, especially in our days, take pride in deeds which would
horrify them at any other time. And the decision to wage war does
not in itself overstep that line, in spite of its tremendous consequences—not
with any nation in the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler himself, at any rate, did not recognize this boundary line
of inhumanity, of nonhumanity, as a limit to obedience in his
relations with his subordinates; and here again opposition would
have been considered a crime worthy of death in the eyes and
judgment of this man, invested as he was with limitless power
and controlling an irresistible machine. What should a man
<span class='pageno' title='492' id='Page_492'></span>
who received an order exceeding the line have done? What a
terrible situation! The reply given in Greek tragedy, the reply by
Antigone in such a conflict cannot be imposed. It would show scant
knowledge of the world to expect it, let alone demand it, as a mass
phenomenon.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Before we come to the specific question of who in the Reich
possessed the power of deciding on war and peace, one more word
remains to be said about the forms which Hitler’s orders assumed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s orders are solely the decisions of this one man, whether
they were given orally or in writing and, in the latter case, whether
they were clothed in more or less ceremony. There are some orders
by Hitler which can be recognized as such immediately. They are
called “Erlass” (decree), such as the decree concerning the institution
of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia of 16 March 1939;
or “Verordnung” (order), like the order for the execution of the
Four Year Plan of 19 October 1936; or “Weisung” (directive), like
the strategic decisions so often cited during this Trial; or simply
“Beschluss” (decision) or “Anordnung” (instructions). Often they
are signed in Hitler’s name only; sometimes we find the signatures
of one or more of the highest civil or military functionaries as well.
But it would be fundamentally wrong to assume that this was a case
of countersignature as understood in the modern democratic constitutional
law of nations ruled constitutionally or by a parliament—of
a countersignature which makes the signatory responsible to
a parliament or to a state court of law. Hitler’s orders were his
own orders and only his own orders. He was much too fanatical a
champion of the one-man doctrine, that is, of the principle that
every decision must be made by one and only one man even to
consider anything else, especially in the case of his own decisions.
We will leave his high opinion of himself entirely aside in this
connection. Whatever the more or less decorative significance of
such countersigning may have been, there was never any doubt that
the Führer’s orders represented nothing but his own decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special attention must be drawn to those laws which appeared
as Reich Cabinet Laws or Reichstag Laws. Hitler’s signing of a
law of the Reich Cabinet represented the formal certification of a
Cabinet decision. In actual fact, however, a stage was reached
where the Reich Cabinet Laws were also merely decisions by Hitler,
who had previously given some of his ministers the opportunity to
state the opinion of their departments. And when Hitler signed a
law which, according to its preamble, had been decreed by the
Reichstag, this was again only a case of a formal certification. In
reality, however, it was a decision by Hitler. From November
1933 onward, at the latest, the German Reichstag was no longer a
parliament but merely an assembly for the acclamation of Hitler’s
<span class='pageno' title='493' id='Page_493'></span>
declarations or decisions. These scenes of legislation appeared to
many people at home and abroad to amount almost to an attempt
to make democratic forms of legislation ridiculous by caricaturing
them; nobody, either at home or abroad, regarded them as proceedings
during which an assembly of several hundred men arrived at
a decision after consideration, speeches, and counterspeeches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There exist, however, also orders by Hitler which are not signed
by him but which can immediately be recognized as his orders.
They are drawn up by a Reich Minister or some other high functionary,
who states in the introduction “The Führer has ordered”
or “the Führer has decreed.” This is not an order by the signatory,
but a report by the signatory on an order given orally by Hitler.
The orders by Hitler as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces
were thus often clothed in the form of such a report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally there are orders by Hitler which can only be recognized
as such by a member of the public if he possesses knowledge of the
constitutional position. When the High Command of the Armed
Forces (OKW) issues an order, it is always an order by Hitler; Hitler
himself, together with his working staff, was the OKW. The power
to issue OKW orders rested solely with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By my explanations regarding the constitution of the Hitler
Reich, I have already—as it were by implication—dealt with the
question as to who was responsible for the ultimate decisions, for
this state’s decisions regarding fundamental questions of existence,
especially for the decision about war and peace. Kelsen said—in
his great treatise of the year 1943,<a id='r57'/><a href='#f57' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[57]</span></sup></a> which I have already mentioned
above—“probably the Führer alone.” We shall have to say: quite
definitely alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under the Weimar Constitution the sole body responsible was
the Reich legislature, for Article 45 demands a Reich Law for a
declaration of war and for the conclusion of peace. And a Reich
Law could be passed only by the Reichstag or by a vote of the
German people. Neither the Reich President, that is, the head of
the State, nor the Reich Cabinet had the power. They might, at
most, have created such circumstances by acts lying within their
jurisdiction—possibly the Reich President as Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces—so as to give the Reich legislature no option
in its decision; a problem which, as far as I know, became a tangible
one in the United States with regard to the relationship of the President
to Congress and was therefore seriously discussed, while it
was never a tangible one for the Germany of the Weimar Constitution.
If, however, the Reich legislature had by means of a law taken
the decision to wage war, the Reich President and the whole State
hierarchy, particularly the Armed Forces, would have been bound
<span class='pageno' title='494' id='Page_494'></span>
by this decision with no right of examination, let alone of objection,
even if all the experts on international law in the world had
regarded the law as contrary to international law. The Weimar
democracy could not have tolerated, any more than any other
nation, a state of affairs in which military leaders as such could
examine the decision to wage war taken by the political leaders,
in the sense that they could refuse obedience if they saw fit. The
military means of power must remain at the disposal of the political
leaders of a state. Otherwise they are not means of power at all.
That has always been so. And it will have to be so all the more if
the duty to give assistance against aggression is really to apply
among the nations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already shown how, in the course of a gradual transformation
which laid particular emphasis on legal forms, Hitler
replaced all the highest authorities of the Weimar period and
combined all the highest competencies in his own person. His orders
were law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The circumstances in a state can be such that the man who is
legally the only one competent for the decision on war and peace,
may have, in practice, no—or not the sole—authority. If, however,
both the sole legal competence and the sole authority in actual
practice have ever been coincidental in any state, then such was the
case in Hitler Germany. And if, in any question, Hitler did ever
go as far as to accept the advice of a third party, then that was
certainly not the case in the question of war or peace. He was the
arbiter of war and peace between the Reich and other nations—he
alone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I conclude: Sentences against individuals for breach of the peace
between states would be something completely new under the aspect
of law, something revolutionarily new. It makes no difference
whether we view the matter from the point of view of the British
or the French chief prosecutors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Sentences against individuals for breach of the peace between
states presuppose other laws than those in force when the actions
laid before this Tribunal took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legal question of guilt—and I am here only concerned with
that—is thus posed in its full complexity, for not one of the defendants
could have held even one of the two views of the legal world
constitution, on which the chief prosecutors base their arguments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Sauter, could we take up the time between
now and 1 o’clock in dealing with that letter, if you have it
now? And possibly Dr. Exner also has his letter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SAUTER: The Defendant Walter Funk was questioned here
as a witness under oath. After his examination, he told me that on
one point his testimony was not quite correct; and he asked me to
<span class='pageno' title='495' id='Page_495'></span>
correct his testimony on this point, since he himself had no opportunity
to do so. On 17 June 1946 I wrote the following letter to the
President of the International Military Tribunal, which is signed by
defendant’s counsel Dr. Sauter as well as by the Defendant Walter
Funk personally. I shall read the text of the letter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Re: Penal case against Walter Funk; correction of the
testimony.</p>

<p>“The Defendant Walter Funk in his cross-examination on
7 May said that he”—that is, Funk—“heard only through
Vice President Puhl of a deposit of the SS at the Reichsbank.
The witness, Emil Puhl, when he was examined, testified that
it was Funk who had spoken with the Reichsführer SS
Himmler and he”—that is, Puhl—“was then informed by
Funk about the deposit to be set up. From the statements
of the witness Emil Puhl the Defendant Funk reached the
conclusion that, in fact, on this point, the statement of the
witness Emil Puhl is correct; and after some consideration,
the Defendant Funk believed that he could recall that it was
he, Funk, to whom Reichsführer SS Himmler first applied
concerning the establishment of a deposit for the SS and that
he then informed Vice President Puhl about this matter.</p>

<p>“The statement by the Defendant Funk under cross-examination
was due to faulty recollection, because of the fact that
these cross-examination questions of the Prosecution had
completely surprised and greatly disturbed Funk. Immediately
after the examination of the witness Puhl, Funk informed
me of his mistake and asked me to correct his factually incorrect
statement on this point, since he himself would have
no opportunity to do so.</p>

<p>“I put forward this request of the Defendant Funk, and I take
the liberty of informing the President of the correct state of
affairs. The Defendant Funk agrees with this correction by
cosigning this letter.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Then there are the two signatures, “Walter Funk” and
“Dr. Sauter.” That is the content of the letter, which I sent on
17 June 1946, to the President to correct the testimony of Funk.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, Dr. Sauter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Exner, have you got your letter so that you can read it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>PROFESSOR DR. FRANZ EXNER (Counsel for Defendant Jodl):
Mr. President, I was downstairs in the General Secretary’s office,
and I was promised it at 1:30, but I have not yet received it. I am
sorry; at the moment I am not in a position to fulfill your request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You probably will have it at 2 o’clock.</p>

<p>Editor’s Note: <span class='it'>In respect to the presentation of the final pleas by
Counsel for the Defense, the Tribunal in several instances directed

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER: Mr. President, I shall read the letter dated 22 June
1946, sent to the International Military Tribunal:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Mr. President:</p>

<p>“During the cross-examination on 6 June 1946, the British
Prosecution presented Document C-139 to the Defendant
Jodl, obviously thinking that the document showed evidence
of preparatory measures for occupying the Rhineland as early
as 2 May 1935 ...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The proceedings were interrupted by technical difficulties in
the interpreting system.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Dr. Exner.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. EXNER:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“... the Defendant Jodl has stated that he did not know
the document. After looking through the document, he explained
that it is quite obvious from the document that in
the West, at any rate, there was no plan for any German
action, but that definitely only defensive measures were
considered. He did not discover where the ‘Operation Training’
was supposed to take place; he could only guess.</p>

<p>“Defendant Freiherr von Neurath has now informed him that
in 1934, during the summer, Mussolini had stationed several
divisions at the Brenner Pass in order to occupy the North
Tyrol in the event of the Anschluss. The Defendant Jodl,
after receiving this information, perused the document again,
and he now imagines that according to this document an
operation was to be prepared to thrust the Italians back
across the Brenner Pass in the event of their marching in.
But he knows nothing about this affair.</p>

<p>“The entire matter has nothing at all to do with the Defendant
Jodl, and for that reason I shall not refer to it during
this session. He is extremely anxious, however, that it should
not appear as if he had attempted to conceal anything.”
It is signed “Dr. Exner,” and “Jodl.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='497' id='Page_497'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now I call on Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, to begin with, I should like to
remark that I have still to complete the Case Katyn. The Case
Katyn could not be incorporated into the book which has been
submitted to the Tribunal, because the hearing of the evidence
only took place on Monday and the day before yesterday. I shall
have to present it, therefore, without its being in the book. It is
only a brief presentation, and the interpreters will receive copies
of my draft. Unfortunately, however, I cannot submit a translation
to the Tribunal at the moment, as the hearing of the evidence was
concluded only the day before yesterday and I could not work on
it before. I shall add this at a suitable moment, and I hope that
in spite of this I shall be finished within the time I mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The proceedings were interrupted by technical difficulties in
the interpreting system.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Is that all right now? Go on, Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: When I mentioned the time I should require
I could not take into account the Katyn Case. Nevertheless, I hope
that I shall be able to finish in the time which I have stated, as I
am shortening the report in some places and I believe I shall have
sufficient time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May it please the Tribunal: This Trial, of truly historical and
political importance, and of great significance in shaping new laws,
is of dimensions such as have not been known hitherto in the
history of law; these proceedings which concern not only the
defendants present in the Court, but which are of the greatest
importance to the entire German people, are now entering upon
a new phase.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defense takes the floor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The position of the Defense in these proceedings is especially
difficult; for there is an all too unequal distribution of strength
between the Prosecution and the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Months before the start of the Trial the Prosecution was in a
position to search all offices and archives in Germany and abroad
with a large staff of experienced collaborators, as well as to
examine witnesses in all countries. Thus they were able to submit
to the Tribunal an immense amount of evidence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The difficult position of the Defense is further aggravated by
the fact that in the Anglo-American procedure on which this Trial
is based there is a clause missing which is contained in the German
criminal procedure according to which the Prosecution is also bound
to procure and submit evidence exonerating the accused...
<span class='pageno' title='498' id='Page_498'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, let me tell you that the statement
you have just made is entirely inaccurate. There is no such
thing as an English code of criminal procedure, but it is the universal
practice for the Prosecution to disclose to the Defense any
document and any witness who assists the Defense and therefore
your statement is entirely false—and I believe that same practice
obtains in the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And as for what you say here about the Defense being under
any unfair difficulties as compared with the Prosecution, that also
is entirely inaccurate because I feel certain that the Prosecution in
this case have observed the same rules that would have been
observed in England and would have disclosed to the Defense any
document or any witness over whom they had control who would
assist the Defense, and there have been various occasions on which
the Prosecution have disclosed in this case to the Defense documents
which have been supplied to them, which appeared to them
to help the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every document which has been put in by the Defense in this
case—or practically every document—has been procured for them
after great efforts by the Prosecution, and investigations have been
made all over Germany and, I may say, almost all over the world
in order to help the Defense in this case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Thank you for your instruction, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the reading of the Indictment, Reich Marshal Göring, in
reply to the question of the presiding judge as to whether he
pleaded guilty or not guilty, declared, “Not guilty in the sense of
the Indictment.” This statement of the accused necessitates an
examination of all the charges made by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The accused has, of course, already during his personal examination
dealt with many questions which are of considerable importance
for his defense. He expressed his opinion in detail with
regard to political and military developments and exhaustively
described the motives for his actions, and the origin and course
of events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I am thankful to the High Tribunal for permitting the accused
to portray matters to the total extent to which he saw, felt, and
experienced them, for only such direct personal portrayal can afford
good insight into the attitude of the accused, thus making it possible
to obtain a reliable opinion of his personality. This knowledge
is absolutely necessary if the Tribunal is to come to a decision
which is not only in harmony with objective law, but which also
renders the maximum of justice to the individuality of the perpetrator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not consider it necessary—after the accused was heard so
exhaustively on all particulars—to deal with every question to
<span class='pageno' title='499' id='Page_499'></span>
which he has already given the requisite explanation. For this
reason I can limit the defense to the following statements:</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are in a transitory period of history of the greatest significance.
An age is coming to an end which has been known less for
its concept of order than for its concept of liberty. This striving
for liberty released tremendous forces—so gigantic that in the end
it was impossible to master them. The tremendous progress this
era has unquestionably made in scientific and technical spheres
we have dearly paid for with the shattering of all human order
and the loss of peace in the entire world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far the profound reasons for such a disastrous development
have hardly been discussed in this Court. But in order to understand
properly the grave crimes and aberrations which are indicted
here it is imperative to throw some light on the historical background.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French chief prosecutor has already pointed out that the
roots of National Socialism are to be found in a period far removed
from us. He goes back to the beginning of the last century. He
sees the first step to a leading astray of the German character in
Fichte’s <span class='it'>Reden an die deutsche Nation</span> (Speeches to the German
Nation). Fichte preached the doctrine of Pan-Germanism, he says,
insofar as he wanted to see the world planned and organized by
others, just as he himself saw it and would have liked it to be
shaped. I cannot understand how this can be taken to express
more than the universal human desire to take part in the shaping
of a common destiny. Only the methods of such attempts to participate
may, at times, be justly criticized.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>A Swiss assertion, which also perceives in Fichte the cause of Germany’s
going astray, seems to me to be clarifying in this respect. It does not, however,
accuse him of Pan-Germanism, that is, of the will to subjugate foreign peoples,
but rather reproaches him for having attempted at all to unite the Germans
into one nation. It contends that this was an inadmissible attempt to imitate
the French and British, whereas it would have been more suited to the German
character to remain a nation made up of different peoples. For only as such
could it have continued its historical mission of remaining the nucleus of a
European federation. Judging by Fichte alone the development is therefore not
so easily interpreted.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>If one wishes to think historically, one cannot simply fall back
on Fichte. For his <span class='it'>Reden an die deutsche Nation</span> was only an
answer to the “Call to Everyone” which the French Revolution had
sent out into the world, and they were directly provoked by the
appearance of Napoleon I. One must go back over the chain of
causes and effects to their very beginning. This, the beginning of
a national and personal striving for liberty which has characterized
the whole of modern times, we find in the Middle Ages.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The colorful play of national and imperial tendencies and
struggles which had been the hallmark of ancient times was overcome
by the conception of one eternal and omnipotent Christian
<span class='pageno' title='500' id='Page_500'></span>
Church. With this a static order superseded the dynamic forces
of the time, an order which according to the doctrine of the Church
was created by the Lord himself and was therefore by “the grace
of God.” It strove to embrace all humans, and to lead them to
peace and rest. It was the teachers of the Church in the Middle
Ages who first ventured to subject war to the principles of law.
Prior to that it was accepted as a natural phenomenon, like sickness
or bad weather, and was often looked upon as a judgment of God.
Men like St. Augustine and Thomas Aquinas opposed this conception
and declared that one must differentiate between a just
and an unjust war. They did this upon the basis and within the
framework of a Christian belief, by which God had entrusted
mankind with the fulfillment of a moral world order to bind one
and all; an order which would provide the answer to the question
of the righteousness or unrighteousness of a war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When by the advent of the Renaissance and the Reformation the
spiritual basis of the medieval order was shaken, this development
into a universal world peace was reversed. Life, formerly tending
toward stagnation and tranquility, now turned into a torrent which,
as it swept ever faster through the centuries, gradually swelled
to the present catastrophe. The individual, thirsting for freedom,
cast off the shackles of Church and class distinction. The State,
declaring itself sovereign, violated the universal order of God as
represented by the Church. Not recognizing any superior power,
it began to conquer as much living space as it could on this earth,
unless the stronger will of another nation did not impose any
natural barriers. Peace hence existed only in the naturally rather
unstable equilibrium of powers obeying only their own laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Thus there came into existence world empires such as the British Empire,
Russia, the United States, and the enormous French colonial empire, which as
living space today comprise more than one half of the surface of the entire
world.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The theory of war as a crime, created by Grotius, the teacher
of international law quoted by the Prosecution, failed because it
was incompatible with the dynamic power of this time. It represents,
as we know, only an attempt to keep alive through secular
arguments the afore-mentioned Christian concept of warfare. One
cannot, however, derive justice from simple nature, for it knows
no other measure than brute force, and always decides in favor
of the stronger. Only metaphysically can justice be defined as an
independent force set above natural impulses. Therefore the theory
of Grotius necessarily petered out in the eighteenth century since,
thinking in a purely worldly sense, it could not find a criterion
for a just war.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>This development from the old order to new liberty, in other words, the
fight of all against all, found its climax and culminating point in the great
French Revolution. By attempting to set human intellect upon the throne of</span>
<span class='pageno' title='501' id='Page_501'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>God, they reached the apex of secularization. Human intellect, however, proved
unable to balance the conflicting ideals of liberty, equality, and brotherliness,
that is, to practice true justice.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From that time on the search for true justice stirs the world.
All socialist theories are merely attempts at solving this problem.
After having been disappointed by the disadvantages of too much
liberty, mankind once again seeks security and order. Some wish
to return to the Christian truth of God, while others want to
proceed in order yet to solve the problem through human intellect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The National Socialists, whose most revolutionary leaders wanted
to go further backward, and at the same time forward to deification
of life itself in a biological-political sense, have been conquered
and eliminated. Yet no solution of the problems of world
order has hitherto been found. The victorious powers hope to
arrive at it, however, in drawing a line between themselves and
the vanquished by jointly indicting and punishing them as criminals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From whence, however, will they take the standard by which
to define justice and injustice in a legal sense? Insofar as such
standards exist by international law as applied up to now, no
further statements are required. That a special Court for the
Trial was created by the Charter of this Tribunal I will not object
to. I must, however, protest against its use, insofar as it is meant
to create new material law by threatening punishment for crimes
which, at the time of their perpetration, at least as far as individuals
are concerned, did not carry any punishment.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>One cannot, by an arbitrary act, suddenly create new law when, after
centuries of revolutionary development, the old universal principles of medieval
law have been gradually abolished and the autonomous thinking of the individual
in the moral field has opened gate and door to anarchy. As we
know, the very cause of the general state of anarchy in the sphere of justice,
from which originated the crimes that are the subject of the accusation here,
was the fact that people had forgotten to differentiate between might and
justice. The success of so many revolutions over once legitimate rulers “by the
grace of God” has shown that might apparently goes before right and that
the latter can be changed at will. By what would it then be possible to tell
what is right except through the force with which it is able to assert itself
and hold its own? This relativity of law which had come about, this positivism
of law, no longer concerned itself with a moral justification of law.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Can one expect that punishment will be recognized as just, if
the culprit was unable to foresee any punishment because at the
time he was not threatened thereby, and therefore believed himself
able to derive the authorization for his way of acting solely
from the political aims pursued? Of what help is reference to the
ethical laws, if such must first be found again? According to
Justice Jackson’s opinion, however, the Nazi Government from the
start was never the representative of a legitimate state which had
pursued the legitimate aims of a member of the international
community. Only from such an attitude can the Indictment for
conspiracy be understood, which will be discussed later. In fact
this Indictment, as the entire argumentation of Justice Jackson,
<span class='pageno' title='502' id='Page_502'></span>
is far ahead of its time. For there were no internationally recognized
standards according to which—outside of positive international
law—the legitimacy of states and their aims could have
been judged, nor was there an international community as such.
Slogans about the legitimacy of one’s own and of the illegitimacy
of foreign aspirations served only the formation of political fronts,
just as did the efforts to brand political adversaries as disturbers
of the peace. Whatever they did, they certainly did not create law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Justice Jackson correctly declared that it would have been possible
for the conquerors to deal with the conquered as they saw
fit. But, said he, nondiscriminatory punishments without a final
and fair establishment of guilt would be a breach of promises
repeatedly given and would be a heavy burden on America’s conscience.
For that reason he himself proposed judicial proceedings
which were to differ from ordinary criminal proceedings by not
admitting the usual tactics of obstruction and delay by the defendants.
However, an establishment of guilt was to be arrived at on
the basis of a just and fair trial. If the defendants were the first
leaders of a conquered nation which had to answer before the
law, they were also the first ones to whom the opportunity was
to be given to defend their lives “in the name of justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this phrase is to have a meaning, then it must also be of
significance for the interpretation of the Charter, because it would
not be reasonable if the Court were obliged to rest exclusively
upon the Charter without taking into consideration the convictions
of others with regard to law. In that case the judgment would
represent a mere dictate of force, against which there would be
no defense “in the name of justice.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter may therefore be applied by the Court only insofar
as its decrees are justifiable in all conscience, not only formally
but also materially. The Charter itself says that nobody shall be
excused for a violation of its decrees on the grounds of orders from
his government or from a superior. In that case it must apply
this, its own logic, also to itself, by allowing the judge to examine
the congruence of its prescripts with the general principles of legal
concept. For a judge, after all, is far more free and independent
of the legislator than a subordinate of his superior, or a subject
of his dictator.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Then there is another question, namely, whether the decrees
of the Charter are really so much in opposition to the previous
and ordinary state of law, especially as to the fundamental ideas
of all rules of law, that the Court cannot acknowledge them as
right or apply them. In practice, the most serious problem consists
in deciding which should have precedence in the case of
conflict—the Charter or the legal maxim <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege</span>.
<span class='pageno' title='503' id='Page_503'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>An attempt has been made to justify disregard of this rule
in this specific instance with the highly political character of the
Trial. Such a justification, however, cannot possibly be accepted.
The political significance of a trial is usually apparent from its
consequences rather than during the course of the procedure and
through the influence exercised upon the legal norms to be applied.
A judge should administer law, and not deal in politics. Still less
is he called upon to rectify mistakes made by the politicians.
Punishment, the establishment of which in due time was neglected,
may only be meted out by him on the strength of a subsequent
law if he would have done so in any case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Basically, the principle of the division of power is presumably
to be maintained. By this principle Montesquieu divided the originally
united power of the absolute king into legislative, administrative,
and judiciary. The three different forms of expression
of state domination were to have equal importance, counterbalance
each other, and so aid in controlling one another. This system of
the division of power characterizes the modern constitutional state.
Straining the point somewhat, one might define the field of activities
and competency of the three different forms of expression
of sovereign authority by stating that the legislature has to deal
with the future, the administration with the present, and the
judiciary with the past. The legislature sets the standards to which
life is to conform. From time to time these must be changed in
accordance with the changed way of living. But until then they
must remain valid.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Insofar as a mere establishment of norms of life is not sufficient
it will be shaped, as the case arises, by the administration. Administration
itself is bound by certain norms, but on principle is
free to move within the lawful bounds of its good judgment, so
as to be able to respond to the daily changing needs. Just as for
the law-making politician, the idea of serving a purpose is its
main consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The judge, on the other hand, may not decide according to the
usefulness, but should decide according to the law. In general, it
is not his task to shape, but to judge. He has to pass judgment on
actions after they have been committed, and examine conditions
after they have arisen in the light of whether and to what extent
they corresponded to the standards, or what juridical consequences
they have brought about. Therefore, as a matter of principle, his
view is directed toward the past. In the life of the state, which is
continuously inspired by politicians looking to the future, he is the
restraining counterpole.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although bound by the laws decreed by the politician, he is not
merely an executive organ. On the contrary, he should control the
<span class='pageno' title='504' id='Page_504'></span>
legislator by re-examining the laws with regard to their conformity
to the constitution. This, logically, ought to include the examination
of whether the principle of the division of power was
maintained, because just as the judge may judge only <span class='it'>de lege lata</span>
and must leave the decisions <span class='it'>de lege ferenda</span> to the legislator, the
latter in turn is obliged to refrain from interfering with the former’s
competency by making laws with retroactive power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The criticism of the administration of justice by the National
Socialist State is mainly based on its having abandoned the division
of power. By putting at the top the political Leadership Principle,
the Führerprinzip, it interfered dictatorially with the competency
of the judges. By means of the Police, that is, the administration,
it arrested and imprisoned people without judicial warrant of
arrest, simply for reasons of political prevention, and even rearrested
those who had been acquitted by the judge and set free.
On the other hand, for political reasons convicted criminals were
withdrawn from the hands of justice. Thereby, quite naturally,
the sureness and clarity of the law were seriously endangered.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>But not even this National Socialist State dared renounce outright the
principle <span class='gesp'>nulla poena sine lege praevia</span>. In its police measures it
dispensed with their justification by the judge exactly as today the execution
of denazification sentences was justly not placed under the jurisdiction of the
Ministry of Justice by the Regional Council of the American Zone, on the
grounds of being “alien to justice.” By three laws, however, the National Socialist
State decreed an increase in the scope of punishment previously in force with
retroactive validity, but they did not provide penalties for acts hitherto unpunishable.
More particularly, this was not brought about by the fact that by
Article 2a of the Criminal Code the possibility of criminal analogy was created,
because by this article a threat of punishment only was created, although not
retroactively; and everybody was enabled to conform.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>A certain degree of protection against arbitrary judgments and
the splitting-up of law lay in the fact that the National Socialist
State was based on a specific ideology by which the judge was
bound. Concerning the close connection between finding of justice
and ideology the Swiss professor of law, Hans Fehr, of Berne,
already in 1927 wrote in his book, <span class='it'>Recht und Wirklichkeit; Einblick
in Werden und Vergehen der Rechtsformen</span>: “Without ideology law
floats in a vacuum.... Whoever has no ideology can have no sense
of right and wrong...”</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Fehr showed that every judge, as far as the law allows him latitude, judges
individually according to his ideology. In an era of liberal freedom of ideology
this naturally brought forth a danger for the uniformity and sureness of the
law. Therefore the liberal state in particular had to make its criminal court
judges conform closely to the codified substance in each case and forbid them
to employ analogies. Fehr already pointed out the danger inherent in such
judgment based on codified substance, tending to give undue preponderance
to the act over the perpetrator. Following the lines of a dynamic jurisprudence,
the liberal school of legal conception, he therefore advocated an extension of
the judge’s authority to create law.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In that sense, as will be understood from the above, the nonliberal states
directed by a definite ideology had taken the lead. The Soviet Union, after
the Marxists had already long ago rejected the liberal, allegedly objective,</span>
<span class='pageno' title='505' id='Page_505'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>jurisdiction as “bourgeois class justice,” was the first to introduce a proletarian
class justice which deliberately abandoned the idea of the equality of
all before the law. The National Socialists, according to their racial ideology,
followed suit by forming the thesis, “Right is what serves the people, wrong
is what injures it.” Inside such a solid ideological frame the dangers of criminal
analogy, which were still further narrowed down by Article 2a of the Criminal
Code, dwindled considerably.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In contrast to this, no fixed ideological base as a foundation for
the Charter is discernible. Since its signatories stand on very different
ideological ground we will have to proceed, as in the international
law valid hitherto, from the liberal idea of freedom of
ideology. Therefore the legal thesis <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege</span> should be
especially sacred to it. This is also proven by the fact that the
Control Council for Germany, by abolishing the criminal analogy
of Article 2a of the Criminal Code, brought the above maxim
back again to all Germans most emphatically.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It would be all the more unintelligible and intolerable for the German
sense of justice if this phrase were not to apply to Germans accused of War
Crimes. In itself the Charter is an exceptional law by the mere fact that it
was created only against members of the Axis Powers and based on an agreement
made for one year and subject to notice. If, in addition, it should abolish
the maxim <span class='gesp'>nulla poena sine lege praevia</span>, specifically for actions
that were not only within the scope of German legality, but under most severe
penalties had even been made a duty by the Government of the sovereign
German State, then all understanding would cease for the interpretation that
the Court is bound by the Charter.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Nor is an examination of the political aims connected with the
Charter of any assistance. Justice Jackson has called the Charter
and the Trial a step toward “creating a juridical guarantee that
he who starts a war will pay for it personally.” The American
commentator Walter Lippmann stated elsewhere that the system
of collective security for the prevention of wars had broken down
because nobody was prepared to declare war on the country
breaking the peace in order to help prevent a war which did not
directly affect them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The means for combating the disease of war would have been
just as bad as the disease itself. In consequence of the fiasco of the
collective methods the conception of basing security in the future
upon holding responsible those individual persons accountable for
breaking the peace was evolved by the enemies of Germany in
the last war. And this finally led to the Nuremberg Trial. Taking
one’s starting point from this fact, today one might say: During
this second World War revolutionary developments have taken
place; it has driven humanity beyond the bounds of what was the
modern age until a short time ago. The first but essential steps
to create a world state have been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The way to peace, as shown here, will be welcomed on principle,
although one will still doubt its absolute reliability. Justice Jackson
himself has expressed doubts whether punishment will serve to
intimidate and thus help prevent breaking the peace in the future.
<span class='pageno' title='506' id='Page_506'></span>
Only somebody certain of victory will decide to wage a war and
thus will not seriously consider punishment, which would reach
him only in the case of defeat. Therefore the educational issue
of this Trial, namely, to strengthen the sense of justice, seems more
important than the effect of intimidation, which can also be achieved
by warning for the future. The politician will have to learn that
the principle of division of power will have to be observed by him,
too, and that he will not find a judge willing subsequently to condone
his mistakes, because he will also punish him on the basis
of subsequent laws. Confidence in international jurisdiction, which
today still suffers from a suspicion of being easily misused for
political purposes, would be heightened considerably through such
a pronouncement. On the other hand, it would most certainly
suffer by the sentencing of acts whose punishable quality remained
doubtful. Thus the violation of the sentence <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege</span>
could not be justified even from the angle of political utility,
although conversely one must realize that the strengthening of the
belief in the inflexibility of justice as the basic pillar of the tremendous
dynamics of political forces serves peace best.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This result cannot be questioned on the basis of the individual
considerations presented by the prosecutors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French prosecutors have pointed out that living international
law could not be imagined without international morals, and that
a moral code has precedence over all claims for freedom by the
individual as well as by the nations. These certainly are facts
well worth bearing in mind. Correctly considered, however, they
speak only for my viewpoint that any strengthening of the sense
of justice must not start out with a violation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the French chief prosecutor declared that without
punishing the chief culprits of Nazi Germany there could be no
future belief in justice, then obviously he went too far. Justice
does not grow out of obtaining satisfaction for the violated sense
of justice at any price. Otherwise we should quickly arrive again
at reprisals, at the endless chain of vendetta. No; justice demands
moderation and consideration of motives and countermotives. And
there the one-sided action taken only against members of the Axis
Powers violates the idea of justice. It is impossible to justify it
by a direct violation of its own principles, that is, of the commonly
prevailing rule: <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege</span>. The British chief prosecutor
himself declared the possibility of subsequent legislature to have
been one of the most offensive doctrines of National Socialist
jurisdiction. He does, however, believe that the possibility of
punishing an act already branded as a crime does not represent
a change of the legal situation but only its logical further development,
and is therefore permissible. I do not at all want to
<span class='pageno' title='507' id='Page_507'></span>
contest the institution of the Tribunal as thereby justified by him.
But the question certainly arises whether this Tribunal is obliged
to punish even though no penal law can be found which threatened
the offenses with punishment at the time of their commission.
To affirm this question would be going much further than the
National Socialist judicial procedure which is so vehemently
denounced by the British chief prosecutor. He did not offer the
slightest motivation for such a course, and appears thus to reject it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, he would certainly be ready to admit that the Charter,
if it not merely presumed but possibly wished to establish that
the acts concerned were punishable, ought to have stated this
clearly and unambiguously. The passage involved, in Paragraph 6
of the Charter, completely lacks such clarity. It reads: “The following
acts, or any of them, are crimes coming within the jurisdiction
of the Tribunal.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>This may be interpreted either as a mere regulation of competence
or, albeit with difficulty, as a regulation originally establishing
some act as being punishable. Therefore, this passage must definitely
be interpreted in favor of the defendants according to the
established legal principle <span class='it'>in dubio pro re</span>. The next phrase, “for
which there shall be individual responsibility,” and the material
regulations for punishment quoted in the following paragraphs,
according to their wording leave no reason for doubt as to their
interpretation. However, they contain only modifications in dealing
with acts established as punishable. The Tribunal may decide
whether or not and to what extent they are compatible with the
principle <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege praevia</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I find the viewpoint of the American prosecutor most difficult
to understand. On the one hand he denounces all legal arbitrariness
on the part of the Nazis, yet on the other hand he is not prepared
to acquiesce in the punishment of the defendants only for those
crimes which were not merely considered reprehensible at the time
they were committed, but were actually threatened with punishment.
On the one hand he does not desire executions or punishment
without first having established guilt in a fair manner; on the other
he demands a strict application of the Charter even where it contains
new laws surprising the defendants. On the one hand he
wants the Trial to appear to future generations as the fulfillment
of the human yearning for justice; on the other, in the face of objections
to the Charter, he invokes the power of the victorious, who
really could have made short work of the defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It seems to me that he speaks too much as an accuser, the sole role he
really wants to assume according to his own words. For the prosecutor—especially
in Anglo-American procedure—the word “justice” has a different meaning
than for the judge, let alone the defendant. Unquestionably Justice Jackson</span>
<span class='pageno' title='508' id='Page_508'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>thinks of himself not only as a prosecutor but to a large degree also as politician.
To him this Trial is to serve not only as an atonement for wrongs committed,
but also, and above all, in order to develop legal principles which he
wishes to enforce by precedence and from which he expects a consolidation of
international law for the prevention of future wars. Whoever approaches a
cause with so many preconceived opinions and intentions lives in so completely
different a world from that of the defendants, that from them to him, and
vice versa, hardly any ways of understanding will be found.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as the political side of this Trial is concerned, I have
already stated why it must not exert any influence on the course
of the proceedings. I merely wish to point out here that a policy
applied by the victors to the vanquished, which perhaps may be
characterized as one of “least resistance,” has once before proved
to be a failure—namely, with regard to the question of disarmament
under the Versailles Treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>If Justice Jackson really wishes to forego straightforward decision by force
and is prepared to become a party to and submit to a legal procedure, although
not bound to do so, then he will have to forego presenting arguments which
do not belong in a legal procedure. A hybrid, which is neither a clear act of
violence nor a trial in the usual sense—however much one may try to place it
in a halfway position under the name of a political trial—is an absurdity. It is
true that history knows of other so-called “political” trials of similarly vague
character. I want to point out only the sentencing of Louis XVI by the French
National Assembly. There, however, it was clear from the composition of the
judicial <span class='gesp'>gremium</span> as well as from the procedure employed, that this was
not a matter of finding justice but amounted simply to a revolutionary act of
violence, and courage to proceed with it was found in mutual exhortation. But
here outstanding professional judges have been entrusted with the proceedings
by the victorious powers. They have been given certain directions by the
Charter, but otherwise their judicial discernment was granted the most far-reaching
authority. There can be no doubt that the politicians called upon
the judges to relieve them of a job which they could not manage themselves.
And now the judges will have to decide by their own competence if and in
how far they are able to execute the mandate. With any remainder the politicians
will have to manage somehow or other on their own.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I was not able to pick a single one from among Justice Jackson’s arguments
which might cause the Tribunal to punish acts which were not punishable at
the time of their perpetration. For this reason I shall examine the individual
points of the Indictment only from the legal situation prevailing at the time
of perpetration.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the crimes of which all the defendants are accused the conspiracy
is most extensive as regards time and object. Professor
Exner, in his capacity as a university teacher of criminal law, has
given special attention to this legal conception for our Trial. In
order to save time by avoiding a duplicate report, Professor Exner
has placed the result of his research at my disposal. In conformity
with him I have to present the following regarding this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concept of conspiracy belongs to the sphere of Anglo-American
law. Even there, however, it is in no way uncontested;
remarkably enough, some opinion in England has it that this conception
is long since obsolete: “It has been said that in England this
law has become entirely disused.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In these proceedings it is a different point that matters. The
concept of conspiracy as used by the Prosecution is entirely
<span class='pageno' title='509' id='Page_509'></span>
unknown to German law. I would like, therefore, to begin my short
legal argument with two questions which give rise to doubts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) May a criminal procedure, bent on realizing justice, employ
legal concepts which are and always have been utterly alien to the
defendants and to the legal trend of thought of their people?</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) How would this be consistent with the rule <span class='it'>nullum crimen
sine lege praevia</span>, a principle which the British chief prosecutor has
acknowledged as a fundamental principle of civilized criminal law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can it be honestly stated that already before 1939 not only the
initiation of an illegal war was held to be an act punishable individually,
but also the conspiracy to initiate such a war? The
affirmative answer to this question given by the Prosecution has
surprised not only Germany. May I clear up, in this connection, a
misunderstanding. It has been said that the National Socialist State
itself had issued criminal laws ignoring the rule of <span class='it'>nullum crimen
sine lege</span>, so that the defendants had no right to invoke this rule.
It is by no means my purpose to defend National Socialist criminal
law, but honesty compels me to say that this is an error. The Third
Reich has—as mentioned before—issued three laws increasing the
penalty for an action with retroactive effect by applying the death
penalty to acts which carried, when committed, prison sentences
only. But in no case so far was a lawful act declared punishable, nor
an act which was not a crime when committed retroactively converted
into a crime. And that is the case here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However, the Charter, which I follow now, has enjoined the use
of the concept of conspiracy. I do not, therefore, go any further into
these questions of doubt. At any rate, it would appear therefrom
that if such a concept is to be applied to Germans, this must only
be done with all limitations imposed by equity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Anglo-American law defines conspiracy as an agreement between
a number of persons to commit crimes, “a combination or an agreement
between two or more persons for accomplishing an unlawful
end or a lawful end by unlawful means.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Similar definitions keep recurring. Two points form the main
characteristics: “agreement” and “common plan.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Agreement means an explicit or tacit understanding. If several
persons pursue the same end independently of one another, then
there is no conspiracy. It is accordingly not enough that the plan
be common to all of them, they must have knowledge of this community
and everyone must voluntarily accept the plan as his own.
The very expression “to conspire” implies that everyone contributes
knowingly and willingly. A person under duress is no conspirator,
for duress does not produce agreement, at the utmost purely external
assistance. For instance, if somebody imposes his will on another,
<span class='pageno' title='510' id='Page_510'></span>
then there is no conspiracy. Therefore, a conspiracy with a dictator
at its head is a contradiction in itself. A dictator does not enter into
a conspiracy with his followers; he does not make any agreement
with them, he dictates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Knowledge and will of the conspirators are aimed at a common
plan. The contents of such a plan can be very different. In English
law, for instance, conspiracies are known for committing murder,
fraud, blackmail, false accusation, certain economic delicts, and so
forth. In all these cases, conspiracy is treated as a crime <span class='it'>sui generis</span>;
and therefore the conspirators are punishable for conspiracy regardless
of whether a murder, a fraud, or even a mere attempt at such
crimes has been committed in any given case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to German terminology, we would say that conspiracy
is one of the cases where even preparation of a crime is punishable.
Such cases are known to German criminal law. The partner in an
agreement for committing a crime against life is punishable. According
to Article 49b he is punishable for a crime of preparing a killing
even if the intended action failed to take place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a certain sense Article 129 can also be applied here. Participation
in an association pursuing certain aims hostile to the state
is punishable, again independently of whether a crime has actually
been committed. But if it becomes a fact, everybody is charged with
his own culpability in this action. If it happens that the individual
conspirator is guilty neither as the perpetrator, nor as an instigator,
nor as an accessory to the actual crime, then he can be charged only
with participation in an association hostile to the state, but not with
such a crime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The prosecutors in this Trial go further. They want to punish,
under certain circumstances, the conspirators for individual actions
they did not participate in. To take the most significant example:
They want to charge a conspirator even with those crimes which
were committed prior to his entering the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the scant material at my disposal, I was not able to find
any evidence that this has any foundation in English or American
law. One thing is certain, however, that such a conclusion is utterly
contrary to the German criminal law, for the latter is based on the
self-evident and unanimously accepted principle that a person is
responsible for an action only when he was the author, or at least
the coauthor of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us now look at the Charter. The Charter quotes two cases
which are declared as punishable and which fall within the competence
of the Court:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Article 6(a) states: Participation in a Common Plan or Conspiracy
for the perpetration of a Crime against Peace. As such are
<span class='pageno' title='511' id='Page_511'></span>
listed the planning, preparation, launching, and conducting of a war
of aggression or of a war involving the violation of international
treaties or assurances. It is remarkable that a concept which belongs
to the internal criminal and civil law of England and America is
applied here, without more ado, to international facts. The Charter
does this by treating individuals who plan or conduct illegal wars
as gangsters participating in a highway robbery. This is a piece
of legal audacity, because in this case the sovereign state stands
between the individuals and the result of their actions, and this
removes all foundation from the comparison with facts in national
daily life. Up to now the concept of conspiracy has been unknown
to international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) According to the last paragraph of Article 6 of the Charter,
the partners in a conspiracy or in a common plan to commit crimes
against peace, the law of war, or humanity are responsible for all
actions committed by any partner while executing such a plan. This
is fundamentally quite another thing from the case mentioned in (1).
It does not mean punishment of the crime of conspiracy, but responsibility
for the individual act of another conspiracy. In other
words, conspiracy, as taken here, is not a crime <span class='it'>sui generis</span>, but a
form of complicity in the actions of the conspirators. Mr. Justice
Jackson has given us an example: If three robbers conspire and one
of them kills the victim, then all of them, through their complicity,
are responsible for the killing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case mentioned under (2) is of the greatest importance in
this Trial. The individual conspirator is to be punished for crimes
committed not by himself, but by another conspirator. One defendant,
who had nothing to do with the annihilation of the Jews, is to
be punished for this Crime against Humanity only because he was
a partner in a conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question at issue is: In this Trial, are principles of liability
to be applied which go beyond our German criminal law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Article 6 of the Charter says that all conspirators are responsible
for any action committed by any one of the conspirators “in execution
of such plan.” These are the decisive words for the interpretation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In my opinion the meaning of these words is as follows: The
other conspirators are also responsible for any actions of their comrades
forming part of the common plan which they helped to conceive,
desired, or at least condoned. A few examples:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Case (a): A, B, C, and D commit a concerted housebreaking in
a villa. They happen to find a girl in the house, and A rapes her.
B, C, and D cannot be charged with this rape. The reason is that
A was not, when committing the crime, acting “in execution of the
plan” but at best “on occasion of the execution of the plan.” The
<span class='pageno' title='512' id='Page_512'></span>
point at issue is not the execution, but merely the occasion arising
while executing the plan. This view, which will hardly be disputed,
is of importance in that it shows that there cannot be any question
of responsibility for all the actions of the partners to the conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Case (b): While exploring the villa, B and C begin to fight about
some loot and B knocks down C. This action, too, was not committed
“in execution of the plan,” but was foreign to the plan. A and
D are not responsible for this “excess.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The third case: While exploring the villa the burglars are detected
by the owner. D shoots him. Now the issue depends on the special
circumstances of the case. Let us, for instance, go back to the
example, quoted by Mr. Justice Jackson, of the three robbers, one
of whom kills the victim. Considering the nature of American
gangsterism, it would appear quite normal that the individual
gangsters concerned bore in mind the possibility of such an occurrence,
and were quite prepared to accept it. If this is the case they
are responsible for the killing, as accessories or assistants, according
to our opinion as well. In such a case there would be no objection
to Mr. Justice Jackson’s solution. But if the case is different, if the
fatal issue had not been foreseen by the others, perhaps could not
be foreseen—for instance, if they assumed that the inhabitants of
the house were away from home—then there exists no liability on
the part of the coconspirators. They are responsible only for acts
incidental to the “execution of the plan.” The common plan, however,
includes only what was foreseen and approved from the beginning.
Other ways of execution are alien to the plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Justice Jackson’s argumentation is deceptive insofar as he
derives a common principle from a decision which clearly and obviously
happens to apply to the “normal case” of his parable of the
robbers and can hardly be applied to any other case. As the case
stands, coresponsibility in any single act could be made to apply
to those conspirators only who foresaw and approved of their comrade’s
act.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A legal principle extending the fellow conspirator’s responsibility
to actions not included in their common responsibility is alien to
German law. Whether or not it belongs to Anglo-American law, the
application of such a principle in the present Trial would make
punishable acts which heretofore could not be punished. This would
clearly contradict the rule of <span class='it'>nullum crimen sine lege</span>, a principle,
as I previously emphasized, acknowledged explicitly by the British
prosecutor, too. In view of the fact that Article 6 can be interpreted
in various ways, we should select from two possible interpretations,
as corresponding to the author’s will, the one which does
not contradict the said principle.
<span class='pageno' title='513' id='Page_513'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>There is such a thing as withdrawal from a conspiracy, and also
later entrance into it. The question is: What about responsibility
for acts committed during the period of nonmembership? The Prosecution
appears to be of the opinion that a person entering into the
conspiracy thereby approves anything previously done by any conspirator
in pursuance of the common plan. Such an assertion seems
to arise out of the civil law theory of a subsequent ratification of
a business transaction. This theory is not tenable in criminal law.
The Charter does not mention anything of the sort; after all, the
common plan, in the execution of which the act was perpetrated,
was common only to those who were members at that time. Even
if one takes the act of joining the conspiracy to be an approval of
any acts so far committed, the approval of a crime already committed
does not establish partnership in such crime. The person
joining later has nothing to do with these crimes. The same applies
to the withdrawal from the conspiracy. The person withdrawing
can be made responsible only for what happened during his membership,
even if the result has come about only after his withdrawal.
Any other opinion would again lead to the result that an <span class='it'>ex post
facto</span> law is being applied. Now, did the 22 defendants participate
in a conspiracy within the meaning of the Indictment, namely, a
conspiracy to commit crimes against peace, usages of war, and
humanity?</p>

<p class='pindent'>If such a conspiracy had existed, then Hitler would have been—nobody
can doubt it—the leader of these conspirators. But it has
already been emphasized that a conspiracy headed by a dictator is
a contradiction in itself. Hitler would have ridiculed the suggestion
that he had made an agreement with his Ministers, Party leaders,
and generals to wage this or that war, or to conduct the war by
such or such means. He was an autocrat. He was not concerned
with the approval of these men, but merely with having his decisions
executed, whether they agreed with these decisions or not.
Quite aside from legal considerations, Hitler’s environment, in fact,
was quite different from a band of conspirators, as visualized by
the Prosecution before the hearing of evidence. Apart from a small
Party clan, he was surrounded by an atmosphere of distrust. He
trusted neither the “defeatist club” of his Ministers nor his “generals.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such was already the case before the war, and his surroundings
during the war have been described by witnesses with great impressiveness.
A cunning system of secrecy insured that the plans
and aims of the Führer remained unknown to his associates as long
as at all possible, so that his most intimate assistants time and again
were taken by surprise by the events, and, in fact, were shocked to
learn some of them only at the present Trial. This system of secrecy
<span class='pageno' title='514' id='Page_514'></span>
also insured an isolation of the individual collaborator, since one
person was not allowed to know what the other did. Does this look
like a conspiracy? In fact, Hitler complained at times that the generals
were “conspiring” against him, and used, strangely, this very
word while speaking of those who today are charged with having
conspired with him. The hearing of evidence repeatedly mentions
conspiracies, but conspiracies against Hitler. From a psychological
point of view it is, to say the least, highly improbable that the score
of survivors of the Third Reich selected and put in the dock by the
Prosecution should have formed a gang of conspirators in the sense
of the Indictment. In this group of people all homogeneity as to
outlook, background, education, social position, and function is
lacking, and some of the defendants only met in the dock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution considers the Party with its organizations as
the nucleus around which the conspiracy formed. We should, however,
in this connection consider the different attitude displayed by
the individuals. Some of the defendants have never been Party
members at all, or, at any rate, not for a long time, and only a few
of them have played an important part in the Party. Some held
top positions in the Party and its organizations, and devoted their
entire activity to the aims of these organizations, while others did
everything in their power to eliminate from their sphere of activity
any influence of Party and SS.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The NSDAP was founded in a period of utter powerlessness of
the State and of general war-weariness of the people at a time
when, truly, no intelligent person thought of a second war, much
less of a war of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But were not some of the defendants’ aims attainable without
war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Presumably every true German from the bottom of his heart
desired the union of all adjoining German territory with the Reich.
This applied to the Saar territory, Austria, Memel, Danzig, and, as
a hope lingering in the far future, also to the Sudeten territory. In
the past they all had been parts of the German Reich, they all would
have returned to the German Reich already in 1919, had the right
of self-determination solemnly promised to all peoples been realized.
But these objectives of German longing could be reached by peaceful
means. And in fact, they had been reached without a shot or a
stroke with the one exception of Danzig, which would have been
managed in the same peaceful way if the Führer had had a shred
of patience and the Poles a shred of good will.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But they neither wanted nor believed in a war. Hitler was
thought capable of large-scale bluffing, but not of launching the
catastrophe of a war. I cannot, therefore, believe in a conspiracy to
<span class='pageno' title='515' id='Page_515'></span>
commit crimes against peace and the usages of war. May I add two
points of general importance:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The first point refers to Göring’s attitude immediately previous
to the outbreak of war. He was at that time Hitler’s confidant
and friend, the country’s second string, and he is now the chief figure
among the defendants. If there had been, in truth, a conspiracy to
launch wars of aggression at that time, then he would have taken
second place within such a conspiracy, yet it was actually he who
tried everything within his power during the last days of August
1939 to prevent the attack on Poland, and who tried behind Hitler’s
back to maintain peace. How can this be consistent with a conspiracy
for initiating wars of aggression? Nor did he approve of a
war against Russia and strongly advised the Führer against such
a war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) If there had been a conspiracy to commit war crimes, then
the war would have been waged, from the very beginning, with
utter ruthlessness and disregard of rules of war. Just the contrary
actually happened. In fact, during the first years of the war, international
law was on the whole respected. Especially in the beginning
every endeavor was made to wage war with decency and
chivalry. If any evidence is needed, a glance at the orders of the
German High Command of the Armed Forces regulating the behavior
of the soldiers in Norway, Belgium, Holland is sufficient proof.</p>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: The Tribunal adjourns until tomorrow.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 5 July 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<div><span class='pageno' title='516' id='Page_516'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-SECOND DAY</span><br/> Friday, 5 July 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I continue.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Number 2. If there had been a conspiracy to commit war crimes,
then the war would have been waged from the beginning with utter
ruthlessness and disregard of rules of war. Just the contrary happened.
In fact, during the first years of the war...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, the Tribunal thinks you got a
little bit further with your speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I had gone somewhat further, that is true; but
in order to get this into the context again I have started again with
Number 2, but if the Court wishes, I can continue where I stopped.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Especially in the beginning every endeavor was made to wage
war with decency and chivalry. If any evidence is needed, a glance
at the orders of the High Command of the Army regulating the behavior
of the soldiers in Norway, Belgium, Holland, is sufficient
proof. Moreover, a leaflet with “10 Commandments for the Conduct
of the German Soldier in Wartime” was issued to the soldiers
when they went into the field. Field Marshal Milch has read them
out from his pay book, during this Trial. They all obliged the soldier
to act in a proper manner and according to international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A gang of conspirators at the head of the state, which plans to
wage a war regardless of right and morals, would certainly not send
their soldiers into the field with a detailed written order saying just
the opposite.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe the assumption of the Prosecution that these 22 men
are conspirators against peace and the laws of war and humanity
is quite erroneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is up to counsel for the individual defendant to show what
connection his client might have had with the alleged conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I just mentioned that Reich Marshal Göring was the second man
in the State. During the Trial the Prosecution also referred repeatedly
to this elevated position of Göring’s and tried to make it the
basis of a special charge against the defendant, pointing out that
<span class='pageno' title='517' id='Page_517'></span>
Göring, by virtue of this advantageous position, knew about everything,
even the most secret matters, and had the possibility of
intervening independently in a practical way in the course of
government business.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This opinion is wrong and is based on ignorance of the importance
of his position. It meant that according to rank Göring was
the second man in the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This rank was due to the fact that Hitler, in the fall of 1934, had
made a will and by a secret Führer order had appointed Göring as
his successor in the Government. In 1935 or 1936 this succession was
confirmed in an unpublished Reich law which was signed by all the
ministers. On 1 September 1939 Hitler announced this law in the
Reichstag. In this way the successorship of Göring became known
to the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Göring’s task of deputizing for the Führer in the Government was
to apply only in the event of Hitler’s being incapacitated by illness
or absence from Germany—this occurred when in March 1938 Hitler
spent a few days in Austria. During Hitler’s presence, that is, as
long as Hitler exercised office himself, Göring derived no special
powers from the deputyship. In this instance his authority was
limited to the offices directly under him, and he was not entitled
to issue any official directives to other offices. From this follows
that, although the second man in the State, Göring could neither
rescind, nor change, nor supplement Hitler’s orders. He could give
no orders whatsoever to offices of which he was not directly in
charge. He had no possibility of giving any binding orders to any
other office, whether it were an office of the Party, the Police, the
Army, or Navy, nor could he interfere in the authority of those
offices which were not his own.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This position as second man in the State cannot, therefore, be
judged as especially incriminating for Göring; nor is it qualified to
serve as a basis for the assumption of a conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Göring never participated in the drafting or execution
of a Common Plan or Conspiracy which was concerned with
the crimes stated in the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As already emphasized, the participation in such a conspiracy
presupposes in the first place that such a common plan existed at
all and that, therefore, the participants had the intention and were
agreed to carry out the crimes of which they are accused. These
presuppositions are not in evidence in the case of Göring. In fact,
one may assume the contrary. It is true that Göring wanted to do
away with the Treaty of Versailles and to secure again a position
of power for Germany. But he believed he could obtain this goal,
if not with the legal means of the League of Nations, at least with
<span class='pageno' title='518' id='Page_518'></span>
political means alone. The purpose of rearmament was only to give
more weight to the voice of Germany. The Weimar Government,
which could not even express the self-determination of the Germans
after 1918 in the surely very modest form of a German-Austrian
customs union, though they advocated this determination themselves,
owed the lack of success of their foreign policy, in Göring’s
opinion just as in Hitler’s, mainly to the lack of respect for the
German means of imposing power. Göring hoped, strengthened in
his belief by Hitler’s surprising initial successes, that a strong German
army by its mere existence would make it possible to secure
German aims peacefully, as long as these aims kept within reasonable
limits. In politics a state can only have its say and make
its voice heard if it has a strong army to back it up, which demands
the respect of other states. Only recently the American Chief of
Staff, Marshall, said in his second annual report that the world
does not seriously consider the wishes of the weak. Weakness is
too big a temptation for the strong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There was no arming for an aggressive war; not even the Four
Year Plan, the purpose and aim of which have been clearly explained
by the defendant himself and by the witness Körner, was
aimed at the preparation of an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Field Marshals Milch and Kesselring have both testified in perfect
agreement that the Air Force created by the armament program
was only a defensive air force which was not fit for an aggressive
war and which was therefore looked upon by them as a risky
proposition. Such a modest rearmament does not allow for any
conclusions of aggressive intentions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After all this it is clear that Göring did not want a war. By
nature he was an opponent of war. Outwardly also, in his conferences
with foreign diplomats and in his public speeches, he has
expressed with all possible frankness his opposition to war at every
opportunity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony of General Bodenschatz explains most clearly
the attitude of Göring toward war. He knew him intimately from
the first World War, and he has exact knowledge of the attitude
of Göring toward war from frequent conversations he has held
with him. Bodenschatz states that Göring repeatedly told him
that he knew the horrors of war very well from the first World
War. His aim was a peaceful solution of all conflicts and to spare
the German people, as far as possible, the horrors of a war. A war
was always an uncertain and hazardous thing and it would not
be possible to burden with a second war a generation which had
already experienced the horrors of one great world war and its
bitter consequences.
<span class='pageno' title='519' id='Page_519'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Field Marshal Milch also knows from conversations with the
Defendant Göring that the latter opposed a war, and that he
advised Hitler in vain against a war with Russia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In public the Defendant Göring, in his many speeches since 1933,
frequently emphasized how he had his heart set on maintaining
peace and that rearmament had only been undertaken to make
Germany strong outwardly, thus to enable her to play a political
role again.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His serious and honest will for peace can best be seen from
the speech which he made at the beginning of July 1938 in Karinhall
before all the Gauleiter of the German Reich. In this speech
he emphasized energetically that the foreign policy of Germany
had to be directed in such a way that it would under no circumstances
lead to war. The present generation had still to get over
the last world war; another war would shock the German people.
Göring had not the slightest reason to hide his true opinion before
this gathering, which consisted exclusively of the highest Party
leaders. For that reason, this speech is a valuable and reliable
proof for the fact that Göring really and truly wanted peace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How deeply the Defendant Göring was interested in maintaining
good relations with England is shown by his conduct at the conference
with Lord Halifax in November 1937 at Karinhall, in which
Göring, with full candor, put before Lord Halifax the aims of
German foreign policy: (a) Incorporation of Austria and the Sudetenland
into Germany; (b) return of Danzig to Germany with a reasonable
solution of the Corridor problem. He pointed out at the same
time that he did not want to reach these aims by war and that
England could contribute to a peaceful solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The meeting in Munich in the fall of 1938 was arranged at his
suggestion. The conclusion of the Munich Pact is essentially due
to his influence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, due to the occupation of the remainder of Czechoslovakia
in March 1939, the relations with England had deteriorated considerably
because England was very angry about this step of
Hitler’s, which was a violation of the Munich Pact, Göring made
serious efforts for the restoration of normal relations. In order
to achieve this goal he arranged the meeting, described by the
witness Dahlerus, with English industrialists at the beginning of
August 1939 in the Sönke-Nissen-Koog. In an address he pointed
out that under no circumstances must a war with England come
about, and he asked those present to contribute to the best of their
ability to the restoration of good relations with England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, after the often-quoted speech of Hitler’s to the commanders-in-chief
of the Armed Forces on the Obersalzberg on
<span class='pageno' title='520' id='Page_520'></span>
22 August 1939, the danger of a war became imminent, Göring
immediately—that is, already on the following day—summoned the
witness Dahlerus from Sweden and endeavored, passing over the
Foreign Office, to reach an agreement with England for the prevention
of war on his own responsibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The objection was raised here that Göring had left Dahlerus
in the dark as to his true intentions. His efforts were not aimed
at the maintenance of peace but only at persuading England to
deny to the Poles the support guaranteed to them and thus to
separate England from Poland, which would enable Germany, after
this separation, to exert pressure on Poland to submit to the
German demands or to attack Poland and to realize her plans
toward Poland without any risk. Any doubt about the honest
will for peace is unjustified; the imputed intention was far from
Göring’s thoughts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If this objection is substantiated by the fact that Göring did
not inform the witness Dahlerus either of the content of the Führer
speech of 23 May 1939 or that of 22 August 1939, then it cannot
be considered relevant and nothing is gained by it. Under no
circumstances could Göring inform a third person—and especially
a foreigner—of those strictly confidential speeches without exposing
himself to the accusation of high treason or treason against his
country. These speeches were all without significance as far as
the task given to the witness was concerned, especially since the
peculiar situation arose here that Göring—after the efforts of the
diplomats had reached a deadlock—as a last resort knew of no
other way out than to use his personal relations, his personal
influence, and his personal prestige.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The only thing that mattered for the activity of Dahlerus was
that the foreign political situation, which had become dangerously
critical through the quarrel between Germany and Poland and
of which the witness was fully aware, had to be straightened out
by an appropriate attitude on the part of England.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That Göring’s aim was not to separate England from Poland
has been clearly proven by the fact that Göring, to begin with,
had transmitted to the British Ambassador in Berlin, Henderson,
the text of the note which contained the propositions made by
Germany to Poland—propositions which were called moderate by
Henderson—and that, hereby, he tried to come to direct negotiations
with Poland. Poland, however, obviously did not want an agreement
with Germany. Several circumstances point to that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conflict with Poland lasted for almost a year. Why did
Poland not ask for a decision by a court of arbitration on the basis
of the concluded arbitration agreement? Why did Poland not appeal
<span class='pageno' title='521' id='Page_521'></span>
to the League of Nations? Obviously Poland did not want any
arbitration regarding Danzig and the Corridor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The utterance of the Polish Ambassador, Lipski, to the First
Secretary of the British Embassy, Mr. Forbes, which was stated by
the witness Dahlerus, is even greater proof of the unwillingness of
Poland to come to an understanding. Lipski said he was not interested
in any note or proposition by Germany; he was convinced
that in the event of war there would soon be a revolt in Germany
and the Polish Army would march in triumph to Berlin. This
intransigent and incomprehensible attitude of Poland obviously finds
its explanation in the fact that she felt too strong and secure as
a result of England’s assurance. The reference to the imminent
revolt makes one believe that Poland was informed of the plans of
the Canaris group. There can therefore be no question of an
ambiguous attitude or false play on the part of Göring.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The serious will of the Defendant Göring to maintain peace
and to restore good relations with England is expressly recognized
by Ambassador Henderson, who, due to his thorough knowledge of
the German conditions and his connections with the leading men
of Germany, summed up Göring correctly. I refer here to his book
<span class='it'>Failure of a Mission</span>, in which, on Page 83, it says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I would like to express here my belief that the Field
Marshal, if it had depended on him, would not have gambled
on war as Hitler did in 1939. As will be related in due course,
he came down decisively on the side of peace in September
1938.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Lord Halifax also, according to the information he gave, had
no doubts that Göring’s efforts for the prevention of war were
sincere.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That after the outbreak of the war, which he had wanted to
prevent with all the means at his disposal but had been
unable to prevent, Göring, as Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force,
exerted all his strength to win the victory for Germany is not
contrary to the sincerity of his will to avoid the war. From that
moment on he knew only his duty as a soldier to his fatherland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At different times Hitler made addresses to the commanders-in-chief
of the Armed Forces, thus for instance in November 1937,
on 23 May 1939, and on 22 August 1939. The Defendant Göring
at his personal interrogation has already given extensive explanations
as to the importance and the purpose of these addresses. For
the question of whether the fact that he was present at these
addresses might constitute perhaps a complicity in a conspiracy in
the sense of the Indictment, it is important that on these occasions
Hitler solely and one-sidedly made known his own opinion about
<span class='pageno' title='522' id='Page_522'></span>
military and political questions. The participants were only informed
of what possible political developments Hitler expected.
The participants were never asked for their opinion nor had they
even any possibility to express their criticism of Hitler’s opinion.
Hitler did not ask his generals to understand his orders; all he
asked of them was to carry them out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His autocratic leadership of the State was exclusively directed
by the principle <span class='it'>sic volo, sic jubeo</span>, which he carried through to
its logical conclusion. How rigidly Hitler followed this principle
can be seen from the fact that after the address of 23 May 1939—as
Milch stated in his testimony—he expressly forbade all participants
to comment on the speech, even among themselves. That
Hitler was irrevocably resolved on an aggressive war could not be
deduced by the listeners of the said speeches, and they did not do
so. This has been confirmed unanimously by all witnesses who
were present when those addresses were given.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At that time Hitler had actually not yet planned a war. In that
respect the testimony of Field Marshal Milch is very informative.
When the witness, in the months following the speech of 23 May
1939, repeatedly pointed out to Hitler in personal reports that the
Air Force was not ready for action with its bombing squadrons
and had hardly any stocks of bombs, Hitler refused to give an
order for the production of bombs and remarked that this manufacturing
was unnecessary and superfluous. Hitler persisted in this
refusal, although Milch pointed out that the production would take
several months. An order to that effect was given by Hitler only
on 20 October 1939.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s discourse before the commanders-in-chief can be easily
explained by the odd inclination of Hitler frequently to develop
political ideas without ever thinking of their realization. In each
case his practical policy resulted from the requirements of the
actual development.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant is accused of having plundered the territories
occupied by Germany, thereby violating the Hague Convention concerning
Land Warfare. This accusation is not justified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During his examination the Defendant Göring has explained in
detail, with absolutely noteworthy reasons, that the Hague Convention
on Land Warfare dating from the years 1899 and 1907 cannot
be made to apply to a modern war, since they had become obsolete
and insufficient in some respects at the beginning of World War II.
At the time when they were drafted, air warfare, economic warfare,
and psychological warfare were still unknown. Total war,
which put the entire people and the entire national economy without
exception at the service of the war, was also not known. Especially,
<span class='pageno' title='523' id='Page_523'></span>
economic warfare was not considered at all. Due to this gap, there
is no international law which has been generally recognized for
economic warfare. Therefore the old statement of Hugo Grotius that
everything is permitted in war (<span class='it'>quod ad finem belli necessarium est</span>)
applies to economic warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, this principle only applies so far as it has not been
affected specifically by a differing settlement through treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following must be said about the legal situation as it stands:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Until the beginning of World War I it was generally acknowledged
in international law—in any case as far as land warfare is
concerned—that the war does not affect any private legal relations
between the citizens of the belligerent states, that private property
on principle was inviolable, that the war would only be pursued
with arms, and that the enemy civilian population would not be
affected by it. This method of warfare suffered a basic change at
the outbreak of World War I, when England, in the field of naval
warfare, applied her interpretation of war of people against people.
At that time the enemy powers resorted to the policy of paralyzing
the entire German national strength, disregarding all established
rules of the law of naval warfare and of neutrality law by cutting
off the necessary raw materials and import of food. This new type
of warfare corresponded to the Anglo-Saxon interpretation, which
was joined by France at the beginning of World War I, that is, that
war is not only fought against the troops in combat but against the
entire population of the enemy. The citizen of the enemy state is
the enemy of England; his property is enemy property, which is
subject to seizure by the British Government. With this, naval
warfare was not only directed against the combat forces, but also
against the peaceful subjects of the belligerent enemy. This goal
was achieved by the total blockade carried out by England. The
Hague Convention did not contemplate a total blockade in the form
in which it was carried out by England. This blockade made any
supplying of Germany through neutral countries impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under these circumstances Germany cannot be blamed for applying
to warfare on land the method used by England by means of
her naval power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This fact leads to the following consideration:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The rules of land warfare, according to their meaning, used to
apply to land warfare. There the principle of protection of private
property obtained. In naval warfare, however, private property was
unprotected. Now, is it possible for the rules of land warfare with
their restrictions to apply to a combined sea and land war? Would
it be just that merchandise should be taken away from a party at
sea who would not be allowed to touch similar goods belonging to
the other party on land?
<span class='pageno' title='524' id='Page_524'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>According to established international law, the principle applies
now as before that private property is actually inviolable during
war. This principle suffers exception only insofar as the Hague Convention
on Land Warfare permits certain encroachments on private
property caused by an emergency in which the state may find itself,
which are deemed justified to the extent in which they appear
necessary in the interests of self-preservation of the state. Within
this scope, therefore, certain actions are permitted during war which
are not normally consistent with the laws of war and actually contrary
to international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the fact that enemy warfare disregarded the established rules
of naval warfare, Germany was driven into a state of economic
emergency. If the enemy powers had observed this established law
of naval warfare, then Germany could have supplied herself through
neutral countries, and the state of economic emergency during the
war would not have arisen. But since the enemy powers failed to
observe the established blockade regulations, how could they expect
Germany to observe the regulations on requisitioning, which form
part of the rules of land warfare?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the action of the enemy powers Germany was thrown
into a state of emergency. The prerequisite for the state of emergency
within international law is, according to the prevailing theory,
an existing or imminent threat of danger to the state, which it is
impossible to avert in any other way and which endangers to the
utmost the vital interests as well as the independence and existence
of the state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, wherever the vital interests of a state are threatened in
this manner there prevails a state of national emergency; this has
the legal effect that such a state does not act illegally when committing
a violation of international law necessary for the repulsion
of imminent danger.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The economic situation of Germany became extremely precarious
during the course of World War II by the action of the enemy
powers. All connections with neutral countries were made impossible
for Germany by the total blockade, so that supplies of raw
materials necessary for the conduct of the war and of food for the
feeding of the civilian population were cut off.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Germany was therefore forced, in order to support her own
economy which would otherwise have collapsed, to use the stocks
of raw materials and food available in the occupied territories and
all other items necessary for the continuation of the war, for herself,
the interests of the population in the occupied territories being
given due consideration. In this, the principles established in the
preamble to the Convention concerning the Rules and Customs of
<span class='pageno' title='525' id='Page_525'></span>
Land Warfare, dated 18 October 1907, as they result from the
customs existing among civilized nations, from the laws of humanity,
and from the demands of public conscience, were strictly observed.
A renunciation of the right to use these resources in the occupied
territories would have meant the abandonment of the independence
and existence of the state; it would have meant unconditional submission.
An emergency involving submission during war is the
supreme and most fatal emergency in the life of a nation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By referring to the state of emergency, however, only such
actions are covered which are necessary to remove a danger which
could not be averted otherwise. The limitations naturally fluctuate,
and it is not always easy to determine in individual cases whether
a genuine state of emergency exists. Here the Tribunal will have to
consider in favor of the defendant the special circumstances and the
wartime conditions, which are difficult to appreciate.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has not been proved that the defendant intentionally or carelessly
infringed these limitations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be left to the examination of the Tribunal whether the
defendant personally can be held responsible for a violation, possibly
committed intentionally or carelessly—a violation which has
been committed exclusively by him in his capacity as plenipotentiary
of the Führer—or whether in such a case there is only a liability of
the state. The Defense are of the opinion that in this case, too, the
problem concerns only a violation of international law which does
not constitute personal liability.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Exceptional conditions prevailed in the eastern theater of war
because there was no private economy in the East, but only a national
economy strictly regulated by a central office. The juridical
situation here was such that property of the enemy state could
generally be claimed as war loot. For the rest, a particularly careful
regulation was made, which was defined in the so-called “Green
Folder.” The regulations contained in this folder did not suggest
any looting or annihilation of the population, as asserted by the
Prosecution. Its tenor was rather the mobilization of economy and
the rules for keeping it going, the seizure and the orderly utilization
of stocks and traffic installations in the zones to be occupied in the
course of fighting, taking into account the fact that far-reaching
destruction was to be expected owing to the Russian attitude. The
folder does not contain any order or indication which might burden
certain groups of the population beyond the needs of war. This
decree, for which the Defendant Göring has taken full responsibility,
does not furnish any reason for disapproval.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all this one must not overlook one thing. This war was of such
bitterness, such proportions, such duration and totality as the creators
<span class='pageno' title='526' id='Page_526'></span>
of the Hague Convention certainly never had or could have even
remotely imagined. It was a war in which nations fought for life
or death. It was a war in which all values had changed. Thus the
defendant was quite right when he declared, “After all, in a life-and-death
struggle there is no legality.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the standpoint of emergency, a justification can also be
found for the deportation of workers from occupied territories to
Germany. In his testimony the defendant stated in detail all the
reasons which in his opinion made this measure necessary. For the
rest, the counsel for the Defendant Sauckel, Dr. Servatius, will
review these matters in detail. Therefore, I do not need to concern
myself with further considerations in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant has made a comprehensive statement in regard to
the charge of spoliation of art treasures, a statement which will be
referred to in order to justify his conduct. In addition it will be
observed that Reich Marshal Göring was not directly engaged in the
safeguarding of art treasures in Poland. Not one of these art treasures
did he take for his own collection. In this respect the defendant
cannot be incriminated in any way.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By order of the Führer such works of art in France as were
owned by Jews were temporarily confiscated for the benefit of the
Reich. They were considered as derelict property, because their
owners had left the country. Of these confiscated objects, with the
express approval of the Führer, Göring received a small part, though
not for himself but for the gallery he had planned, in which he also
intended to incorporate the works of art already in his possession.
He wished to acquire these objects at a price estimated by French
art experts, the proceeds to be distributed among the dependents of
French war victims.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The juridical situation, therefore, was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The objects were confiscated by decree of the Führer for the
benefit of the German Reich. By this confiscation the former owners
lost their right to possession and it was transferred to the Reich.
Such objects as were ceded to him, Göring acquired from the Reich
as their present owner. The Reich obviously saw in this a step
which, though it was proved premature by the course of events, was
intended to anticipate the peace treaty to be concluded at the end
of the hostilities, when the final accounts would be made. This is
similar to the confiscations and seizures of property carried out at
present in Germany in view of the ultimate peace treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whether the Reich Government was juridically entitled to confiscate
the goods and to become their owner is a moot question. A
solution of the question is no longer necessary, because Göring acted
in good faith in the matter of this acquisition. In his testimony he
<span class='pageno' title='527' id='Page_527'></span>
emphasized his belief that he was entitled to acquire these things,
as they had been previously confiscated by a Führer decree. In consideration
of these facts there cannot be any question of looting.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In any event there can be no objection to the purchasing of
articles in the course of normal business transactions, which the
defendant was offered spontaneously, the sellers being only too
eager to dispose of them in view of the good price they received.
The same applies to objects which the defendant acquired through
a voluntary exchange, in which the other party to the contract
enjoyed the same rights as himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I will now deal with the accusation of the shooting of 50 officers
of the British Air Force after their escape from the prisoner-of-war
camp Sagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indictment reads as follows: “In March 1944, 50 officers of
the R.A.F., who had escaped from Stalag Luft III in Sagan, were
murdered after their recapture.” According to a later declaration
of the Prosecution the circumstances were as follows: During the
night of 24 to 25 March 1944, 76 officers of the R.A.F. escaped from
the prisoner-of-war camp Stalag Luft III in Sagan. 50 of these officers
were shot by the Security Service after they had been recaptured.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Investigation must bear on the following points: Who gave the
order for the shooting? Did Reich Marshal Göring play any part
in this affair? Did he actually take part in the drafting of the order
to shoot these 50 airmen? Did he approve the measure, although it
was a grave offense against Paragraph 50 of the Geneva Protocol
dealing with the treatment of prisoners of war?</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution states that the Defendant Göring collaborated
in the drafting of this order. It referred, among other things, to
the reports which Generalmajor Westhoff and Criminal Counsellor
Wielen drew up while they were in British custody. But the interrogation
of these witnesses in Court, as well as the bringing forward
of further evidence, which has been so carefully gone into before
the Tribunal, has shown in the meantime that the previous statements
of Westhoff and Wielen were inaccurate, and in respect to
Göring’s presence at the conference and his knowledge of the shooting
order were only based on suppositions which had their roots in
the fact that it was a question of a prisoner-of-war camp for airmen.
The result of the evidence was as follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this general conference on 25 March 1944 Himmler reported
the escape of the 76 officers to the Führer. For this Hitler severely
reprimanded Field Marshal Keitel. He considered the event a great
danger to public security, since the escaped officers might assist the
6 million foreigners in Germany in the organization of an armed
<span class='pageno' title='528' id='Page_528'></span>
revolt. Then Hitler gave the order: “The prisoners will remain with
Himmler.” Keitel definitely refused to hand over to Himmler the
15 officers who had already been recaptured by the Armed Forces
and returned to the camp, and these officers remained unharmed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At this general conference in the presence of Keitel, Hitler did
not order the shooting of the prisoners who were to remain in
Himmler’s hands. Neither Keitel nor Jodl expected such measures.
Jodl expected the escaped prisoners to be sent to a concentration
camp for some time. Keitel and Jodl agree in their testimonies that
Reich Marshal Göring did not attend this meeting. Therefore, it
cannot possibly be correct that Field Marshal Keitel declared in a
conversation with General Westhoff that he had been reprimanded
by Göring at the general conference on account of the prisoners’
escape.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Koller has testified that General Korten assured him
over the telephone, about the end of March or beginning of April
1944, that the Luftwaffe, that is, the Reich Marshal and Korten
himself, were not involved in the order and had only been informed
of it later. Furthermore Koller testifies that the Reich Marshal was
extremely angry about the shooting. These statements are completely
in accordance with the declarations of Reich Marshal Göring,
who was on vacation at the time of the conference with Hitler. The
fact of the escape reached him only through a telephone report by
his adjutant. It was only after his return from vacation, some time
around Easter 1944, that he learned through his Chief of General
Staff, Korten, about the fact that shootings of prisoners had taken
place. Reich Marshal Göring was much upset about this last report
because he condemned the deed in itself and, moreover, feared
reprisals for his own airmen. Upon inquiry, Himmler then confirmed
the executions to Reich Marshal Göring with the justification
that an order to that effect had been issued to him by Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is made clear by this conversation how the execution was possible
and how its perpetration could remain concealed from the
Wehrmacht. In the absence of Keitel and Jodl, Hitler issued the
order to Himmler to carry out the execution and Himmler thereupon,
unknown to the Wehrmacht, immediately passed on the order
to the Reich Security Main Office, that is, after Kaltenbrunner’s
approval, to Müller or, as the case may be, to Nebe.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Not only did Reich Marshal Göring remonstrate with Himmler
because he had executed the order without informing Göring, but
also raised the most vigorous protest against this measure in a subsequent
interview with Hitler. This resulted in heated controversies
between Göring and Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Göring strongly condemned such proceedings, he requested
shortly afterward that the prisoner-of-war camps be taken in
<span class='pageno' title='529' id='Page_529'></span>
charge by the OKW. On being questioned Field Marshal Keitel confirmed,
as a witness, that a few weeks after the occurrence he
received a letter from the General Quartermaster of the Luftwaffe,
in which the Luftwaffe requested the taking over of its camps by
the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This result of the examination of evidence, correcting the initial
statements of the witnesses Westhoff and Wielen, which are contradictory
in many respects, as well as Keitel’s earlier declaration of
10 November 1945, also justifies the assertion that Reich Marshal
Göring was in no way involved in this affair, that he condemned it
most severely when he was informed of it, and that he, therefore,
cannot be called upon to answer for this extremely regrettable and
reprehensible order, which it was not within his power to prevent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has gone on to the question of “lynch law” as
resorted to by the German population in isolated cases in 1944 when
enemy airmen had been shot down. For these occurrences, the
defendants, especially Reich Marshal Göring, are held responsible.
The charge that the Defendant Göring or the Wehrmacht are in any
way involved in this action, that they issued orders or instructions
to this effect or even merely approved the action, is seen to be
entirely unjustifiable. The examination of evidence in this case has
thoroughly cleared up the matter in favor of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To support their charges against Reich Marshal Göring, the
Prosecution invokes first of all a protocol of 19 May 1944 (Document
L-166) concerning the so-called “Hunting Conference” which was
held on 15 and 16 May 1944 under the direction of the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Numbered as Item 20 of this memorandum is a statement by
the defendant saying he would suggest to the Führer that terrorist
enemy airmen be immediately shot at the scene of their offense.
The defendant most definitely denies having made any pronouncement
to this effect and justly points to the following circumstances
which belie any such statement: The session lasted for 2 days, and
numerous technical and organizational questions were discussed.
The question touched upon in Item 20 had nothing whatever to do
with the agenda for the rest of the session, least of all with the
purpose of the session. The remark is placed in the midst of themes
which deal with matters of an entirely different nature and has no
point in this connection. Besides, Göring, had he approved and
wished it, could himself have immediately issued such an order
without further ado, as he knew the Führer’s attitude on this point.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The decisive fact is that the statement is in the sharpest contradiction
with the fundamental attitude of the defendant. He always
stood for the view that the enemy airman who was shot down was
a comrade and must be treated as a comrade, a fact which I have
already remarked upon in another connection. Moreover, in the
<span class='pageno' title='530' id='Page_530'></span>
question as to how terrorist airmen were to be treated, he defended
his position with all frankness against the conception held by Hitler
and made no secret to Hitler of his entirely different opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of this unwavering attitude and its resulting policy, it
is utterly out of the question that he should suddenly have urged
Hitler to issue the above-mentioned order against the terrorist airmen—an
order which he opposed with all his might and the execution
of which he sought to prevent by every means as soon as it
came to his knowledge. And he did succeed in fact in preventing
the execution of this order. If the terrorist airmen were actually
discussed at the conference, this discussion could only have occurred
with the implication that the Führer suggested such a measure.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With reference to the minutes, the following general remarks
must be added: They consist of summary notes by a young officer,
stretching over a two-day session during which there had been a
great deal of talking and discussion. Experience acquired in many
other cases has shown that such recordings are often very unreliable
and have even at times reproduced the subject of the discussion in
an utterly distorted form, precisely because the person taking notes—especially
when several participants were present and talking at
random—could not follow the course of the discussion and consequently
did not reproduce the substance of it accurately, especially
when, in addition to this, he was mixing up the people; this explains
many factual errors as well as the inadequacy and unreliability of
such records. The minutes were never submitted to the defendant.
He has not therefore been able to verify their contents nor to correct
their errors.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Records of this sort, which were taken down in the way described
above and which are not submitted for perusal and approval by the
parties concerned, are worthless in the production of evidence. They
cannot in themselves alone serve as an adequate means of proof
either to charge or convict the defendant. They can, therefore, only
be made use of to the detriment of the parties implicated when the
content matter is confirmed by other material brought for evidence
from sources other than these minutes. In the present case there is
no confirmation from other evidence that Göring actually made the
statement contained in Item 20 or made a request to Hitler to
that effect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The note dated 21 May (Document 731-PS) fails to provide support
for the claim. The note, “General Korten, according to a speech
by the Reich Marshal, reports...” cannot, in view of the defendant’s
uncontested statement, possibly mean that the Reich Marshal delivered
an address on this matter in Hitler’s quarters but solely that
Korten reported on this subject to the Reich Marshal and that
Korten informed the Reich Marshal of Hitler’s order.
<span class='pageno' title='531' id='Page_531'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The rest of the examination of evidence has made it clear beyond
doubt that Göring was against a special treatment of enemy terrorist
airmen who had been shot down and that he opposed Hitler’s order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness Colonel Bernd von Brauchitsch pointed out during
his interrogation on 12 March 1946 that in the spring of 1944 there
was a sudden increase in losses among the civilian population
through machine gun attacks by enemy airmen. These attacks by
enemy airmen were directed, within Germany, against civilians
working in the fields, secondary railway lines without any military
importance, and against pedestrians and cyclists. This constituted
a gross violation of the Hague Rules of Land Warfare, according to
which any combat act against the noncombatant population of the
country is prohibited; and any attack or shelling of open cities, villages,
residences, or buildings is forbidden.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the opinion of the witness Von Brauchitsch, this
behavior, which quite evidently violated international law, caused
Hitler to order specific measures against these aviators, besides general
defensive measures. In this regard Hitler advocated, as far as
it is known to the witness, the most severe measures; lynch action
was to have a free run.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This attitude of Hitler toward the violations of international law
by enemy aviators, however, did not meet with the approval of the
Armed Forces, especially not with that of Reich Marshal Göring and
his Chief of Staff, General Korten. Both of them did condemn to the
utmost the attacks of enemy aviators, which were exclusively directed
against the defenseless civilian population. However, they nevertheless
opposed the handing over of defenseless, shot-down aviators
to the aroused mob for lynch action; and they did not consider such
measures to be an appropriate means of combating this conduct,
however much in violation of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness General Koller expressed himself to the same effect.
Early in June 1944 General Korten informed this witness of the fact
that the Führer intended to decree an order to the effect that terrorist
aviators were to be surrendered to public fury.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In the course of repeated conversations the witness Koller and General Korten
arrived at the opinion that the conception of the Führer must be rejected. They
certainly considered the direct attacks of low-flying enemy planes on individual
civilians, women and children, concentrations of civilians, school classes and kindergartens
out on walks, farmers at work in the fields, as well as attacks on
public passenger trains and hospitals, to be ruthless. However, the two did not
see a way out or a solution of the difficult problem in the Führer’s order. They
were of the opinion that such an order was contrary to basic military conceptions,
the Articles of War, and international law, and that it would give rise
to numerous evils through which both enemy and German crews would come
to harm. And finally such an order might exercise, by its effects, a harmful
influence on the morale of German crews.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>All these reasons caused the Armed Forces to reject Hitler’s demand, and their
attempts were now directed toward preventing the conception of Hitler from
being put into practice. The witness Von Brauchitsch credibly states that the</span>
<span class='pageno' title='532' id='Page_532'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>Armed Forces now looked for a way out finally found in the fact that the higher
command levels were deceived by measures which were not actually carried out.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The witness Von Brauchitsch was ordered by Reich Marshal Göring to define
in discussions with the OKW the concept of terrorist aviators. In the subsequent
discussions and exchanges of correspondence those cases were mentioned which
represented violations of international law and which were to be considered
criminal acts. By this definition of the concept, lynch law was to be prevented.
The exchange of correspondence, which lasted for quite a long period of time,
showed the tendency of the office to protract the matter as much as possible.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The witness Koller is justified in emphasizing that this exchange of correspondence
shows every sign of a “delaying action to gain time,” that is, those
concerned either did not want any decision or at least wished to postpone it as
long as possible.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In particular the marginal note on Document D-785, Exhibit
GB-318, “No answer to be obtained from Commander-in-Chief of
the Air Force,” admits of the conclusion that the Reich Marshal purposely
wanted to prolong the matter. Furthermore Reich Marshal
Göring, as can be clearly seen from the letter of 19 June 1944, maintained
the opinion that in every instance he considered legal procedure
against terrorist aviators as definitely necessary. Where it is
stated in a subsequent document of 26 June 1944, “The Reich Marshal
agrees with the formulation as communicated defining the concept
of terrorist aviators and with the suggested procedure,” such
agreement with the procedure refers exclusively to the procedure
of publication suggested in the final paragraph of the letter of 15 June
1944, for which Reich Marshal Göring’s approval had been requested.
That Reich Marshal Göring until the end of the war maintained the
old aviator standpoint, according to which enemy aviators, once they
have been shot down, are to be considered and treated as comrades,
was not only expressly deposed by the witness Field Marshal Milch,
but is also emphasized by General Koller in the following words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>Notwithstanding occasional expressions of displeasure, the attitude of
the Reich Marshal always remained correct and chivalrous in accordance
with the flying tradition which he had retained from the first World War
and frequently emphasized. In understandable anger about great difficulties
in air defense, and pressed by the Führer, he perhaps once in a while
used harsher words which were quickly forgotten.”—And the witness does
not know of any case—“in which such a fit of ill-humor caused the Reich
Marshal to take incorrect or harsh measures against members of the
enemy air forces.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The behavior of the Air Force as a whole was also correct and humane at all
times. To fight chivalrously was a matter of honor with the German aviators. The
Air Force as well as the Defendant Göring retained this point of view, although
as Koller expressly mentioned, the flying personnel felt extremely bitter over
the strafing attacks on German crews suspended on parachutes and individual
hotheads spoke of equal measures as reprisals.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The best testimonial for the exemplary comradely behavior of the Air Force
even toward an enemy who did not observe the rules of warfare can be seen
clearly from the description of the witness Koller about the establishment of a
maritime life-saving service of the Air Force, which brought aid to Germans and
enemies in equal measure and which carried on despite enemy attacks in violation
of international law.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It can thus be said that the Armed Forces and the Defendant
Göring rejected lynch law, as well as all procedure against the
<span class='pageno' title='533' id='Page_533'></span>
terrorist aviators not in accordance with legal regulations, and did
not issue any orders to troops under their command; in no case
have enemy aviators been shot by the Air Force or by the Army,
or handed over to the Security Service (SD).</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution accuses the Defendant Göring of having established
a reign of terror in Prussia immediately after 30 January 1933
in his capacity as Prussian Minister of the Interior and soon afterward
as Prussian Prime Minister, in order to suppress all opposition
against the Nazi program. In order to carry out his plans
he had used the Prussian police, which he had ordered as early as
February 1933 to protect the new government by proceeding ruthlessly
against all political opponents without consideration of the
consequences. In order to safeguard and consolidate power, he had
created the dreaded Secret State Police and established concentration
camps as early as the spring of 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To these accusations the following is to be said:</p>

<p class='pindent'>All this was only natural and cannot serve as an accusation
against the defendant; rather would it have been a severe violation
of the duties entrusted to him, if he had not devoted himself with
all his strength to the safeguarding of the new government and
taken every imaginable precaution in order to make any attack on
this new government impossible from the very beginning. In order
to achieve this goal, the first step concerned the police institutions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It only remains to be examined whether the means which the
defendant considered it necessary to apply were objectionable. The
question must be answered in the negative because of the following
considerations:</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every state the police is the inner-political instrument of
power; in every state its task is to support the government, to protect
it in every direction and to render the disturber of the peace
and the violator of the law harmless, if necessary, by force of arms.
The defendant assigned these tasks to the police under his direction,
whom he ordered, in the speech mentioned by the Prosecution, to
act energetically and to fulfill their duties conscientiously. Why
such an appeal for the performance of duty should not be permissible
is incomprehensible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In his interrogation the Defendant Göring described expressly
for what reasons and along which lines he considered a reorganization
of the police necessary, and these directives cannot be objected
to.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should like to point out in this connection that according to
the prevailing rules of international law a sovereign state has a
right to regulate its internal affairs as it deems fit. The reform
of the police is an exclusively internal affair. The violation of
<span class='pageno' title='534' id='Page_534'></span>
generally recognized rules of international law is, therefore, out
of question in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A political police was also in existence in Prussia before the
assumption of power. Before 30 January 1933 it was called Police
Department 1a, which among other things had to watch and to
combat political adversaries, at that time the National Socialists
and Communists in particular. Such a police, dealing with the
same tasks, was also needed after the assumption of power in
order to protect the new state against attacks which threatened it,
in particular from the very strong Communist Party.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to make clear that this department of the police was
charged exclusively with safeguarding the state against enemies
of the state it was named “Secret State Police.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>As long as the Defendant Göring was head of the Police—this
was, in fact, the case only until 1934, when Himmler was put in
charge—he strictly confined himself to the tasks prescribed to him
and did not transgress his authority, and no misuse of power worth
mentioning occurred. Nor has the evidence produced shown
anything against the Defendant Göring for this period of time.
Should, at a later date, the Secret State Police have transgressed
their authority and committed illegal acts, the defendant had no
knowledge of it and did not approve of it. For mistakes and crimes
committed by his successors, which remained unknown to him, he
cannot be held responsible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now there appeared before the Court a witness whose testimony
was very incriminating for the defendant. This was the
witness Dr. Gisevius. The defendant refuses to deal with this
witness and his statement. He merely wishes to point out that
this statement is untrue in all points which incriminate him. The
conclusiveness of the witness’s statement depends on whether he
is considered to be credible or not. Dr. Nelte has agreed to deal
with this question extensively, so that, in order to avoid reiterated
statements, I shall refrain from further declarations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Naturally, the assumption of power by the National Socialist Party
met with some resistance, and in particular the leftist parties were
anything but satisfied with the situation thus created. The opponents
were by no means weak either numerically or in the means
at their disposal. The new rulers were, therefore, apprehensive
of serious danger to their power if they allowed the opposition
parties to continue their activity without hindrance; accordingly
they had to take preventive measures against such dangers in
good time. In order to stabilize their own power and to nip in
the bud any possible source of unrest, the Defendant Göring considered
it necessary for reasons of state to arrest at one blow
<span class='pageno' title='535' id='Page_535'></span>
both leaders and officials of the Communist Party and its organizations.
The defendant himself has spoken at length explaining
his reasons for such acts. For the removal of danger and to insure
the safety of the state, the measures taken by the defendant were,
for the Government, a necessity caused by the unrest of the time.
Since it was a preventive measure, it was not requisite before a
provisional arrest that a criminal act against the Government had
already been committed or was obviously on the verge of being
committed. The fact of membership in itself and previous activity
in that party was sufficient to warrant arrest as a political act of
self-protection on the part of the Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such considerations very soon after the assumption of power,
led to the establishment of concentration camps, of which there
were two at the time when the Defendant Göring was at the
head of the Police. The purpose of such camps was to hold temporarily
politically unreliable persons, who might be of danger
to the new state, until they had either adapted themselves to the
new political conditions or until the power of the state had become
so great that such persons could no longer endanger it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The legal basis of this institution was the Reich President’s decree of 26 February
1933 for the protection of people and state. Reich President Von Hindenburg
issued this decree on the basis of Article 48, Paragraph 2, of the Reich Constitution,
in order to prevent Communist armed risings dangerous to the state;
accordingly, the decree was perfectly constitutional. The decree temporarily
suspended certain constitutional rights and declared legal, among other things,
the restriction of personal liberty.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The establishment and use of concentration camps was founded, according to
the defendant’s ideas at the time, on the revolutionary conviction inherent in the
victorious Movement that it was the sole expression of historical truth, that it
alone represented the right path, and that therefore everything was wrong that
stood in its way.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>There was no political discussion of the right political concept based on logical
arguments, as in ideologically neutral liberalism; there was only the totalitarian
establishment of a popular regime based on creed as the historically necessary
truth.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Any person not caught up by this Movement but; on the contrary, opposing
it, was therefore to be removed as an enemy of the true order. Under such
conditions, the person concerned could not simply be punished for an infringement
of specific rules in the traditional course of justice; but, according to the opinion
of the National Socialist Government, he deliberately segregated himself from
the newly found community of the people and from every foundation for any
legal institution. He had therefore to be removed. There was, accordingly, no
question of punishment but of a political purge based on ideological intolerance.
Therefore no tribunal or administrative procedure was allowed on behalf of the
persons concerned for the examination of the police proceedings. The individual
who excluded himself from the community was not entitled to legal guarantees
which the Constitution provided for his fellow countrymen. And a fellow countryman
was he only who recognized such a community. In handling enemies of
the people not only legal principles were applied, but also the viewpoint of the
necessities of state.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Since it was an act of political expediency, the Defendant Göring could decide
in some cases on his own responsibility that there was no necessity for further
confinement and could use all his influence to procure the liberation of individuals
who did not endanger the security of the state. In that case it was not a question
of an act of grace breaking through any legal principle, neither was it</span>
<span class='pageno' title='536' id='Page_536'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>tantamount to an acknowledgement of an injustice done to the other persons concerned;
it simply was an act undertaken from the point of view of expediency,
each case being decided on its own merits.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Such principles in handling elements which fail to fit into a totalitarian political
rule are by no means specifically National Socialist; they also dominate the policy
of the victor countries toward the conquered German population. Anyone who
does not obey the newly arising democratic order in Germany, even anyone of
whom an essential opposition to democracy can be expected because he was
grounded in National Socialism before, is now interned. Whereas—according to
Document R-129 of the Prosecution—21,000 people were in concentration camps at
the beginning of the war in Nazi Germany, more than 300,000 National Socialists
and militarists are held in internment camps in the U.S. Zone alone, according
to figures published by the occupation powers.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>A recently published decree of the Länderrat in the American occupation zone
confirms the fact that such acts of political purging are not legal but political
acts. This decree removes from the authority of the administration of justice and
transfers to the authority of the general administration of the State all workers’
camps in which are interned Nazis who have been sentenced to forced labor on
account of their Party membership; and this decree is issued because these camps
are foreign to the administration of justice.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Those were the only considerations which influenced the
Defendant Göring when he created concentration camps in 1933
and issued laws concerning the Secret State Police. These were
intended to be, as he conceived them, a means of cleansing and
strengthening the young community of the people. He did not
aim at a definite annihilation of political enemies but, after a
certain period of education, interceded generously for their release
and discharged, at Christmas 1933, about 5,000 and in September
1934 about 2,000 prisoners.</p>

<p class='pindent'>He vigorously counteracted inevitable abuses and errors which
he openly admitted in the book he published in 1934, intended for
the British public, <span class='it'>The Building of a Nation</span>. For example, he permitted
the Communist leader Thälmann personally to report to
him about his complaints in the concentration camp and took care
to have them remedied. He dissolved the so-called “wild” camps
of Stettin and Breslau, punished the Gauleiter of Pomerania who
had organized this camp without his knowledge and against his
will, and had those responsible for these “wild” concentration camps
brought to trial for their infringements of the regulations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This attitude of the Defendant Göring denotes that he never
intended the actual physical annihilation of the prisoners. If the
Prosecution establishes that this was all in execution of a conspiracy
which aimed at committing Crimes against Humanity, such an
interpretation has no bearing on the actual political life during the
years in question. Such a conspiracy did not exist, nor was it the
intention of the defendant to commit crimes against the principles
of humanity, nor did he commit any such crimes. As one of the
political trustees of the German Government, he felt himself bound
to safeguard it against dangerous disturbers of the peace and
thereby to guarantee the future of the National Socialist way of life.
Far from looking upon such measures as criminal, he considered
<span class='pageno' title='537' id='Page_537'></span>
them, on the contrary, to be the inevitable means of consolidating
the political order as a basis of all law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In 1936 the leadership of the Police, and therefore the management
of the concentration camps, passed from the defendant to the
Reichsführer SS; Heinrich Himmler. The defendant cannot be held
responsible for the subsequent development of the concentration
camps nor for the fact that they became, especially after the outbreak
of the war, more and more gruesome places of torture and
death and led—partly intentionally, partly on account of the chaotic
war conditions—to the death of countless people and finally, in the
last days before the breakdown of Germany, turned into one vast
graveyard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Certainly he knew that there still were concentration camps, also
that the number of inmates had risen because of war tension and
that they contained foreigners because of the expansion of the war
machine over all of Europe; but the terrible happenings which have
been disclosed in this Trial were unknown to him. He knew nothing
of the inhuman experiments which were being carried out on inmates
in misinterpretation of true scientific methods. The testimony
of the witness Field Marshal Milch has shown that the Luftwaffe
was not interested in these experiments and that the defendant personally
did not learn anything specific at all about this matter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By no means did the establishment of concentration camps as
such have anything to do with the later extermination of Jews,
which apparently originated in Heydrich’s and Himmler’s brains and
was kept secret in a masterly manner until it was disclosed after the
collapse as the horror of Auschwitz and Maidanek.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This brings me to the Jewish question. The Defendant Göring
has explained in detail his views on the Jewish question during
his interrogation as witness; furthermore, he has shown in all detail
the reasons which influenced the National Socialist Party and, after
the seizure of power, the State, to take a hostile attitude toward
the Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant is reproached for having promulgated the Nuremberg
Laws in 1935, which were intended to keep the race pure, and
for having, in his capacity as Delegate for the Four Year Plan,
issued decrees during the years 1938 and 1939 which had as their
aim the exclusion of Jews from economic life. Furthermore he is
blamed for a number of other laws which meant a one-sided and
serious intervention into the legal sphere of Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The legal reason for this reproach is obscure. For this deals
with a purely domestic problem, namely, the regulation of the legal
status of German subjects; according to internationally recognized
legal opinion at that time, the German Reich as a sovereign state
<span class='pageno' title='538' id='Page_538'></span>
was free to settle such a matter. Even if these encroachments were
harsh and the limitations of citizenship rights extremely severe, they
nevertheless in no way represent an offense against humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Legal provisions which limit a certain race or a certain circle
of citizens in their legal position have been made by other states
without offense being taken at such measures and without other
states considering themselves bound to intervene. Reich Marshal
Göring always rejected any illegal or violent action against Jews.
This is clearly shown by his attitude toward the action against Jews
during the night of 9 to 10 November 1938, instigated by Goebbels,
of which he was informed only after the deed had been done and
which he condemned most severely. In this respect he raised serious
objections with Goebbels and Hitler. On this matter, the precise
statements of the witnesses Bodenschatz and Körner are available.
The testimony of Dr. Uiberreither shows how greatly Göring disapproved
of this action. According to the former, the defendant
summoned all Gauleiter to Berlin several weeks after this incident
and in an address sharply censured this violent action, which was
not in keeping with the dignity of the nation and which caused
serious damage to German prestige abroad. That the defendant was
no race fanatic became generally known by his expression, “I decide
who is a Jew.” It has been established sufficiently that he aided
many Jews.</p>

<p class='pindent'>About a biological extermination of the Jews he learned only at
the end of the war. He never would have approved such a measure
and would have opposed it with all his might. For he had too much
political insight not to recognize the tremendous and at the same
time senseless dangers which would perforce result for the German
people from such a brutal and horrible act of extermination. Göring
had already made it clear in the above-mentioned speech to the
Gauleiter that he did not wish to fall foul of the world public and
world opinion because of the treatment of the Jews. It is therefore
out of the question that Göring should have approved of such an
undertaking or participated therein in any manner, although it is
natural that it should be put to the defendant that he must have
been informed about such horrible measures as the second man in
the State.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore it is no wonder that the statements of the defendant
that he knew nothing of these atrocities should meet with a certain
amount of distrust. Despite such doubts, however, the defendant
insists that no information about such acts ever reached him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This ignorance of the defendant, which can be completely understood
only by one familiar with German conditions, may be explained
from the fact—and this is the sole solution of the riddle—that
Himmler, as was also emphasized by General Jodl during his
<span class='pageno' title='539' id='Page_539'></span>
interrogation, knew truly masterfully how to keep his actions secret,
to obliterate all traces of his atrocities, and to deceive the surrounding
world and even his and Hitler’s closer entourage. In this connection
I also refer to the testimony of the witness Hoess, who
confirms Himmler’s instruction concerning absolute secrecy toward
everyone.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question may come up here: Did not a legal obligation exist
for the defendant to make investigations about this matter and to
get reliable information as to the true whereabouts of supposedly
evacuated Jews and as to their fate? And what legal consequence
results if he negligently refrained from investigating and by such
negligence violated his legal obligation to act, incumbent on him by
virtue of his position? The decision of this extremely complicated
question of law and fact may be considered a moot question, because
Göring, even as the second man in the State, did not have the power
to prevent such measures if they were carried out by Himmler and
were ordered, or at any rate approved, by Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, yesterday I already stated that I still wished to
deal with the Katyn case; and I intend to do so now, before I go
on with my conclusion. I am sorry I was not able to get any translations
because the testimony was only given a few days ago. However,
this matter is not very long. The interpreters have a copy.
I shall begin with this report now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A detailed opinion has still to be given on the Katyn case, in
which the taking of evidence was concluded only a few days back.
The Russian Prosecution based their indictment on the findings of
an investigation which is set down in Document USSR-54. The following
conclusion is drawn from the entire evidential material as
presented:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Polish prisoners of war, who were in three camps west of
Smolensk, were still there in these three camps when the Germans
came into Smolensk, up to and including September 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) In the Katyn forest German occupation troops undertook the
mass shootings of the prisoners of war from the aforesaid camps in
the autumn of 1941.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) The mass shooting of the Polish prisoners of war in the Katyn
woods was carried out by the German military authorities who had
camouflaged themselves under the code name “Staff of Construction
Battalion 537” at whose head was Lieutenant Colonel Ahrens,
together with his collaborators First Lieutenant Rex and Lieutenant
Hodt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The question is, did the Prosecution prove this accusation? This
question must be answered in the negative. No confirmation of guilt
can be found from the contents of this document. The accusation is
<span class='pageno' title='540' id='Page_540'></span>
made against a definite military unit and names specific officers.
The time mentioned for the perpetration of this deed is September
of 1941. The Katyn forest is given as the scene of the crime. In view
of the scanty facts, which considerably restricted the accusation, it
was merely the task of the Defense to prove that this assertion
would not bear examination.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First of all, let us consider the persons involved. Colonel Ahrens,
who is obviously the Lieutenant Colonel Ahrens mentioned, is eliminated
as the perpetrator because this deed is said to have been
committed in September 1941, while Ahrens did not take command
of Regiment 537 until the end of November 1941. He arrived only
at that time at Katyn and had never before been in the eastern
theater of war. Before Ahrens, Colonel Bedenck was in command
of the regiment and he joined the regimental staff in August 1941.
Before Bedenck, First Lieutenant Hodt took lodgings in the little
Dnieper castle in July 1941, immediately after the capture of Smolensk.
He came with an advance unit of the 537th Regiment and
remained there until the arrival of the regimental staff, to which
he was not yet attached at that time. He was transferred to the regimental
staff only in September 1941, and from that time on he lived
permanently in the little castle.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Special facts which would incriminate Hodt or Bedenck cannot be
derived from the document which has been submitted, and such
facts have not been presented here. Therefore, it is not proved that
Bedenck and Hodt could be considered as perpetrators.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The following circumstances contradict the theory that Unit 537
or any other military unit had participated in this act. The Polish
prisoners allegedly fell into the hands of the Germans in the three
camps west of Smolensk. Thereby they would have become German
prisoners of war. The fact that they had been captured would have
had to have been reported to Army Group Center. Such a report
was not made, as testified by the witness Eichborn. Considering the
tremendous number of prisoners, it is quite out of the question that
anyone could inadvertently have failed to make a report of that
nature. Apart from that, the capture of 11,000 Polish officers could
under no circumstances have been concealed from the Army Group.
As results from the testimony of General Oberhäuser, the Army
Group never had any knowledge of this.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the statements of the two witnesses, Eichborn and Oberhäuser,
it can be concluded that at the time of the capture of Smolensk
by the Germans there could not have been any Polish officers
present in these camps. Moreover, no eye witnesses who saw the
officers after that date were interrogated by the Russian commission.
The railroad employee who was interrogated on this subject
knows nothing from his own observation.
<span class='pageno' title='541' id='Page_541'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, allegedly these 11,000 prisoners were taken from the camps
to Katyn. The transport of so many Polish prisoners could not have
been concealed from the Russian population even if the transport
had been carried out most unobtrusively and secretly, nor could
shootings on such a large scale have taken place without the Russian
population taking notice of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Even though this little wood was blocked off, at a distance of
about 200 meters there was a public highway open to traffic, and
this highway was used daily and to a great extent by the Russian
civilian population. Anything that took place in the little wood of
Katyn could be seen from this highway.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the direct vicinity of the Dnieper castle there were isolated
homesteads which remained occupied by the owners during the
whole time of the German occupation, and there was constant contact
with the regimental staff. There are no reliable statements and
testimony dealing with either transport or the observation of shootings.
The Germans would hardly have chosen the site on which the
graves were found for such a mass execution. Owing to its situation
between the main road and the regimental quarters, this site was
quite unsuitable for such a misdeed. As I have already stated, there
was lively traffic not only on the nearby road, but also in the direct
vicinity of the graves which were near a small road connecting the
regimental headquarters with the main road. The executions could
also have been observed by soldiers who had nothing to do with it.
Even the unit selected to carry out the deed would have been very
unsuitable. A technical unit, such as a signal corps unit, is the least
suitable for such a task.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witnesses Eichborn and Oberhäuser did not move into these
quarters near the site of the deed until 20 September 1941, and they
can only testify as to what they themselves observed from that date
on. But from the end of July there was an advance unit near the
castle and from August, a regimental staff. It is, however, quite
out of the question that in this span of time or perhaps 6 weeks this
act could have been perpetrated. The few people who were available
were so overburdened with military tasks that in this short
time it would have been quite impossible for them not only to kill
11,000 prisoners, but also to remove the bodies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the statement of the Prosecution, Russian prisoners
of war allegedly helped to remove the bodies. That has not been
proved. None of the Russian population had ever seen such prisoners.
In no case could all traces of the deed be effaced so quickly
and the scene so speedily cleared that the witnesses Oberhäuser and
Eichborn on their frequent trips to the Dnieper castle would not
have noticed some suspicious signs.
<span class='pageno' title='542' id='Page_542'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony of the witness who was heard here is not sufficient.
He merely heard a story of such shootings from a certain
Menschagin who cannot be found now. This witness did not make
any personal observations. He himself did not see any Poles. He
was told by students that they had seen Poles but they did not
know the number of Poles or where they were being kept. Testimony
which is so scanty in every respect is worthless, and the
testimony given by the two doctors heard as witnesses is not adequate
for use in the sense of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Within the scope of the evidence admitted by the Tribunal, it
would not have been possible to clarify completely all the medical
questions which were decisive for the experts in the facts you have
established. Therefore, the Defense has also refrained from calling
a medical expert to exonerate the defendant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There is one thing, however, which must not be overlooked in
this connection. The expert opinion obtained by the German Government
was given by 12 members of a commission of leading representatives
of legal medicine from European universities, while the
expert opinion referred to by the Prosecution was deposed by a
group of Russian experts only. The first expert opinion should be
given preference since it was compiled by experts who were
completely nonpolitical.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the Witness Professor Markov in his examination went back
on the opinion contained in the report of 30 April 1943. He claims
that already at that time, due to his findings upon making an
autopsy on the bodies, he failed to agree with the report that the
shooting took place in the months of March and April 1940. However,
this testimony must be met with considerable misgivings. The
witness could give no plausible explanation why, in view of his
opinion, he did not lodge an immediate protest against the version
of the report of 30 April 1943 or refuse his signature, nor why, at
least, he later...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Dr. Stahmer, you realize, of
course, that you have not offered in evidence the report of this
German commission. You expressly refrained, as I understand it,
from offering the report of the German commission. And you...</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, that is a mistake. I did not
refrain from doing so. I was not permitted to submit the <span class='it'>White
Book</span>, but I was permitted to submit the report of 30 April 1943.
However, I could not submit it immediately, for it was contained
in the <span class='it'>White Book</span> and I was to have copies made. These copies were
made and submitted. I used some of the passages from the protocol,
with the express approval of the High Tribunal.
<span class='pageno' title='543' id='Page_543'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I know you did, and of course if you want
to offer it there will be no objection to your offering it; but certainly
I understood that you were only offering in evidence the parts which
you read to the witness. That, I think, was put to you at the time
you were cross-examining the witnesses on behalf of the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That is what I understood, but if you say that your interpretation
was different and that you want to offer the whole of the report,
then the matter will be considered by the Tribunal, if the Tribunal
has not already considered it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Are you saying that the Tribunal has already allowed the whole
of that report to be offered in evidence?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, unfortunately the book...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Stahmer, what you are desiring to offer
in evidence is the conclusion of the report or the protocol or whatever
it is called, is that right? That, I take it, is not a very long
document, is it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: No, Mr. President. May I explain again. I am
sorry but I have not received the transcript of the session. Therefore,
I do not know just what is contained in this protocol; but I
do recall—and one of my colleagues confirmed this to me just now—that
at the time I was permitted to submit the entire so-called
report of the commission, and I quoted certain passages not only
from the conclusion but from the whole report, and with the
permission of the High Tribunal I proposed to submit the entire
report later.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, I do not know what you mean by the
whole report or what you mean by the protocol.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: Mr. President, may I describe it once more.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This was a rather comprehensive protocol which described the
findings of the investigations. It contained the entire facts of the
case and it concluded with a joint expert opinion. It is composed,
as I have stated, of facts and reasons. It contains, first of all, a very
comprehensive statement in which the facts as they appeared to the
experts are described individually. For instance, that they interrogated
the Russian population on the spot, checked over the
site of the graves, held a post mortem—all of these things were
presented by me from the record with the permission of the High
Tribunal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, may I be permitted to make another remark to
clarify these matters? I remember this incident quite particularly
because you, Mr. President, first mentioned it and asked whether I
had another copy of this protocol. I answered, “No, I have only
the <span class='it'>White Book</span>.” Then that was submitted to the witness, whereupon
I suggested that the other witness be called so that in the
<span class='pageno' title='544' id='Page_544'></span>
meantime I could have a copy made of this protocol. Then you,
Mr. President, thought it had better not be so but that I should
take the book and then submit a copy afterward.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal will look at the record to
see exactly what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: As I said, I did not see the transcript myself.
If it was not taken down like that, then the record is not complete.
However, I do remember quite clearly that that is what took place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will continue then.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: The statement of the witness is subject to considerable
doubt. The witness could give no plausible explanation as
to why, in view of his attitude concerning the form of the protocol
of 30 April 1943, he did not lodge an immediate protest and refuse
to sign it or why he did not at a later date at least acquaint the
other experts who participated with his true scientific conviction.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through this testimony the German experts’ opinion cannot lose
its weight and become weakened, especially since the other 11 experts
obviously endorsed the statements set forth in this report.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Considering this state of affairs it will not be necessary to set
forth the individual reasons which speak for the correctness of the
statements contained in the German <span class='it'>White Book</span> of 30 April 1943.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time given by the Russian experts for the shooting, that is,
the autumn of 1941, is determined arbitrarily; and it cannot be true
in any case for the corpses wore winter clothing, as the witness
Markov noticed on the corpse upon which he performed an autopsy.
The fact that ammunition for pistols of German make was found
in the graves does not permit the conclusion that this shooting was
necessarily carried out by Germans. In the German <span class='it'>White Book</span> it
has already been pointed out that the German factory which produced
this ammunition delivered a great deal to other countries,
especially to the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In conclusion, it can be said that the task of this proceeding is
solely to determine whether the 11,000 Polish officers were shot after
the capture of Smolensk by the Germans, in other words, that this
deed could have been committed by Germans. The Prosecution have
not succeeded in proving this fact and therefore this accusation will
have to be struck from the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I come now to my closing sentences, my conclusion.
I imagine it will take me roughly a little more than 10 minutes
and think it would be best to give this conclusion in unbroken
continuity. Either I will have to speak until after one o’clock; or,
if I may be permitted to make a suggestion, the Tribunal might
recess now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Shall I continue now?
<span class='pageno' title='545' id='Page_545'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you can finish in 10 minutes we will go on
until you finish, Dr. Stahmer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I will not quite have finished in 10 minutes, and
I should like to point out particularly that I would not like to have
to interrupt my concluding remarks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Perhaps if it would be more convenient to
you—we will do whichever you like; we will recess now, if you like.
It is a very hot day and we will recess now if you prefer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I would prefer to have the recess now. I do feel
the heat a little today, Mr. President.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='546' id='Page_546'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. STAHMER: I come now to the summary.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reviewing the personality and life of the Defendant Göring,
the following points must be considered for the appreciation of his
actions:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Provided at home with a good educational background and
training in character, he was moulded decisively as a young officer
and combat airman during the first World War, in which he proved
his outstanding worth, receiving the highest award for bravery, the
decoration <span class='it'>Pour le Mérite</span>. He experienced the collapse of the
German war effort as a consequence of, as he saw it, German
treachery from within.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the rule of the Kaiser had been overthrown, the German
people wanted to give themselves a new constitution on a democratic
basis and then hoped to be able to work their way up again
by industry and perseverance. In this, the confidence in the far-sightedness
of the victor powers of that time, and especially in the
14 points of Wilson, played a great part. But when the Treaty of
Versailles utterly frustrated these hopes, the Weimar democracy
fell into a serious crisis from which it was not to recover. This,
together with the subsequent world economic crisis, formed the
undeniable prerequisite for the fact that Hitler was able to seize
power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>First, the “fight against Versailles” made his rise as a Party
leader possible. Göring, as a witness, described how he agreed with
Hitler at their first meeting that nothing could be achieved by
written protests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The powerlessness of the German democracy had by then
become apparent to the entire world. Göring like Hitler was convinced
that Germany inevitably must become a victim of Bolshevism
unless it was possible to muster against it sufficient defensive
strength by the re-establishment of German self-confidence at home.
That Germany was also forced to take a firm stand against the
Versailles powers was a matter of course. In this Hitler unquestioningly
seized upon the fact that Germany belonged to the West—culturally,
economically, and also politically. He believed that the
Bolshevist danger, which in the first place was directed against
Germany, would ultimately also threaten the Western countries.
Therefore he was of the opinion that he would be able gradually
to gain their recognition and support if he took up the ideological
struggle against the East.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this basic attitude alone is it possible to explain his entire
policy until the actual collapse. One may rightly condemn it today
as having been a failure from the outset, but one cannot ignore the
<span class='pageno' title='547' id='Page_547'></span>
fact that initially certain things in the development clearly seemed
to justify it. And this explains how Hitler succeeded in making an
ever-increasing part of the Germans his followers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Göring firmly believed that salvation could come only through
Hitler. He recognized in him the born national leader who knew
how to influence and to guide the masses and whose hypnotic willpower
shrank before no obstacle. He realized that under a democratic
constitution only such a man of demoniacal demagogic talent
was able to prevail. And therefore he joined him.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Because Göring was a true and honest German, inspired only by
love for the fatherland, he did not even think of using Hitler only
as a tool for his own advancement. On the contrary, he took it upon
himself from the beginning to recognize in him the man who alone
decides, in other words, the Führer, and to be satisfied with a subordinate
role. Therefore the famous Air Force captain and holder
of the order <span class='it'>Pour le Mérite</span> did not hesitate to swear the oath of
allegiance to the then still unknown Hitler, an oath which was to
hold good for the rest of his life and actually did so. It is tragic
that a struggle such as that led by Göring and Hitler could be so
completely misunderstood as to be considered from the very outset
as a conspiracy for the purpose of committing crimes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>His aim was at first directed towards freeing Germany from the
shackles of the Treaty of Versailles. It is true that the Weimar
Government had made repeated attempts to be released from the
most onerous obligations of this treaty. However, Germany was not
successful in her endeavors for a revision. No progress was made
by negotiating. Did not international law appear to be only an
instrument in the hands of the victors of Versailles to keep Germany
down permanently? Was it not still true in the world that might
came before right and that the Germans would achieve something
only if they had the courage to shake their fists?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such considerations appear absolutely understandable from the
situation of that time. To construe from them a proof for the conspiracy
alleged by the Prosecution would mean a complete misunderstanding
of the facts. Actually, the development after 1933 seemed
at first to prove Hitler completely right. He easily achieved with his
methods much more than—if given voluntarily—would have kept
the Weimar Government in power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the willingness of the foreign countries not only to conclude
treaties with Hitler—such as the Naval Agreement of 1935
and the Munich Pact of September 1938—but also to participate to
the end in the Party rallies, the German people could only conclude
that Hitler had chosen the correct road for reaching international
understanding. This impression and this judgment were absolutely
correct until the fall of 1938. Had Hitler afterwards observed loyally
<span class='pageno' title='548' id='Page_548'></span>
the Munich Agreement, then he would probably have stayed the
arguments for the “stop” policy which was initiated against him.
Not only would peace have been maintained, but Hitler could also
have harvested the fruits of his domestic and foreign policy pursued
until then and recognized by all powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Basically, the argument today centers only on the question of
whether the developments since then and their catastrophic consequences
should be charged solely to him or to others. All Germans
who followed Hitler at any time and in any way are accused. For
the prosecutors maintain—above all those who put no trust in him
from the outset and who denied the legitimacy of his government
from the beginning—“It was to be foreseen that he would end as he
did!” Therefore, everyone who supported him at any time and in
any way also shares in the guilt.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this accusation it must be objected that retrospectively it
invests the sad results with an inevitability which would destroy all
belief not only in freedom, but also in the wisdom of man. Of course
Hitler himself did not desire the end as it came. He often enough
announced at the beginning that he was not out for the laurels of
war but that he would like to devote the rest of his life to peaceful
constructive work. From a truly objective point of view, one can
reproach him only for not having limited his aims when he could
no longer believe in their achievement by peaceful and humane
means.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If by such means only those are to be understood which renounce
force of any kind, then there would have been no need for him to
go his own way and seek a new solution. A certain play with force,
as long as it did not get out of hand, will, therefore, have to be
conceded to him. Where it got out of hand can only be determined,
for lack of other proof, by the results which he actually caused with
his policy. He certainly did not foresee and intend the bad results.
However, it must be considered his fault that he did not accept the
lesson of his failures but allowed himself to be goaded to still
greater extremes. But how much of this guilt can and may be
charged also to his followers?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever did not reject Hitler’s methods, and thereby him personally,
from the very beginning as illegitimate, found it difficult
to recognize where the political aims set by Hitler ceased to provide
justified reasons for his measures, and where beyond that the policy
became a crime. The dividing line in this respect was from the
standpoint of the purely German legal conception probably considerably
different from that of other nations or even the world. For
the latter, for example, were hardly interested in the maintenance
of the Weimar constitution and the basic rights granted by it to the
individual German. Its violation, therefore, up to the second World
<span class='pageno' title='549' id='Page_549'></span>
War has never caused other states to intervene with the German
Government. On the other hand, once the war had broken out, the
Germans were forced to put German interests above their sympathy
for members of other, especially enemy, states. Each believed
himself to be doing enough if he took care in his sphere to see that
unnecessary harshness was avoided. To revolt against orders from
the highest German authority would not only have been completely
senseless and hopeless, but, until shortly before the bitter end, it
would also have been a violation of German legality and thereby a
punishable offense. Reproaches for failure to revolt can, therefore,
be made only if the breach of formal legality, without consideration
of the immediate practical effect and only for the sake of the
principle—which is the attitude of a revolutionary—could be defined
as a legal obligation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequences of such a conception are so far from the point
that they cannot be considered seriously at all, because hitherto
existing international law was primarily based on the principle of
unlimited sovereignty of the states. No country has been willing to
submit vital and decisive questions to the judgment of others, no
matter to how great a majority or to however independent a tribunal.
And now every individual citizen of such a sovereign state was
to have had not only the right but even the duty toward the other
nations or humanity to rebel against the legal system of his own
country because it violated the rights of man and humanity? Such
an imposition, made retroactively, pronounces its own sentence. It
would place the autonomy of the individual above state sovereignty.
Thereby the power of the individual person would not only be
immeasurably overestimated, but this would also necessarily lead to
the breaking of the last ties of traditional order, to anarchy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To this way of thinking Göring virtually represents the exact
opposite pole. Just as others went to war in order to fight against
war as such, he became a revolutionary in order to restore honor
to the concept of loyalty. Thus, having once cast his lot with the
Führer, he stood by him when he had already lost the latter’s confidence,
in fact, even after he had been sentenced to death by Hitler.
He remained loyal until today, in spite of everything, by excusing
Hitler again and again. To many this may appear incomprehensible,
and many may see in it a sign more of weakness than of strength.
But this loyalty reveals his whole personality. Göring has occasionally
been described as a late Renaissance type; and there is something
in that. Although of high intelligence, he allowed himself to
be guided in his actions less by reason than by the dictates of his
warm heart.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such a man expresses himself of necessity in a way that is
primarily subjective. He does not look upon the people surrounding
<span class='pageno' title='550' id='Page_550'></span>
him and upon others impassionately as factors to be reckoned with;
but he feels, above all, what effect they have on him and how they
challenge his approval or disapproval so that he finally makes his
personal reaction to them the basis for his over-all judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But still, as can be seen from the statements of Generaloberstabsrichter
Dr. Lehmann, he always endeavored to be just and to
lend an ear to sensible arguments. He always kept himself free
from doctrinal prejudices. As a soldier, he always endeavored to
do the right thing in each case. His decisions on points of law as
well as his social interest, which General Bodenschatz testified to
among other things, show his earnest moral sense of responsibility.
His attitude toward all criminal acts directed against the honor of
women are proof of his chivalry. But in all this he is not guided
by a dogma but by his spontaneous common sense, <span class='it'>ergo</span> not by
intellect, but by life. From actual life he derives his ideas and the
values which determine his actions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore the Führer and the oath of loyalty he had taken to him
meant everything to him and were the substance of his life. Ambassador
Henderson had judged Göring correctly, when he wrote about
him:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“He was the perfect servant of his master, and I have never
seen greater loyalty and devotion than he maintains toward
Hitler. He was recognized as the second power in the country,
and always gave me to understand that he was Hitler’s natural
successor as leader. Men in secondary places often tend to
emphasize their own importance. In all the open discussions
in which I engaged with Göring, he never spoke of himself
or the great part which he had played in the Nazi revolution;
Hitler had done everything, all confidence was confidence in
Hitler, every decision was Hitler’s and he himself was
nothing.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This judgment still applies today. But his loyalty became his
disaster. For him a world had gone to rack and ruin. He certainly
recognized many a mistake of the past, but he did not show the
repentance which many would have liked to see in him. He thereby
remains loyal to himself as well. And this completes the picture
of his character.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In a period still threatened by chaos, in which men are again
searching for a firm foundation for life, the positive value of such
loyalty should not be ignored.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, I understand that you have not
had your speech translated into any of the languages. Is that so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, I told the General Secretary yesterday
the reasons which made it impossible to have the speech translated.
However, I have given the Language Division the text in
<span class='pageno' title='551' id='Page_551'></span>
German; and I was told that the German text would be a big help
in carrying out the translation as quickly and as accurately as
possible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, the Tribunal has already pointed out
to you, many days ago, that it is very inconvenient to them not to
have a copy of the speech before them. If you propose to make a
speech, they will do the best they can to appreciate it. It makes it
very much more difficult and very much more inconvenient not to
have the speech translated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I shall see to it that the translation is made as
quickly as possible for the case of the Defendant Frank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Very well; go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal, when in
1918 the German Army, after more than 4 years of heroic struggle,
laid down arms, this was done in confidence of the assurances
repeatedly given by President Wilson in 1918. In his speech before
Congress on 8 January 1918, the President of the United States of
America, in 14 points, had demanded among other things...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Dr. Seidl, the Tribunal has
already intimated, as you must know, that the question of the 14
points and the question of the justice of the Treaty of Versailles is
irrelevant. They do not propose to listen to it. You have been told
that before, and many documents have been rejected which dealt
with this subject.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, I do not intend to comment on the
question of whether the Versailles Treaty is just or not. The point
is this: The Prosecution have submitted the Versailles Treaty in
evidence. They made the Versailles Treaty the main point of the
Indictment especially as concerns Count One of the Indictment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My investigation aims at the following: First, was the Versailles
Treaty formed legally? Second...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I spoke only of the injustice of the Versailles
Treaty. But it is even more irrelevant to question whether the Versailles
Treaty is a legal document or not. We do not propose to
listen to your contending that the Versailles Treaty is not a legal
document. There are plenty of matters which are of material
moment for your client which you have to discuss before us, but
that is not one of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, I cannot leave the Tribunal ignorant
of the fact that the Versailles Treaty and its consequences, especially
the causal relationship with the seizure of power by National
Socialism, form a considerable part of my speech and it will be...
<span class='pageno' title='552' id='Page_552'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, I have told you that the Tribunal
will not listen to your contending either that the Versailles Treaty
was not a legal document or that it was in any way unjust. On those
topics we do not propose to hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I must construe the attitude of the Tribunal
to mean that I will not be permitted to speak of the consequences
of the Versailles Treaty, and particularly about the connection
which these consequences had with the rise of the National Socialist
Party and with the seizure of power by Adolf Hitler and the co-defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Look. The Versailles Treaty is, of course, a
historical fact; and the Tribunal cannot prevent you from referring
to it as a historical fact. But as to its justice or as to its being a
legal treaty, the treaty which Germany signed, you will not be
heard.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As you have not laid your speech before us, we do not know
what you are going to say. But we will not listen to that sort of
argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall begin on Page 6 of the German manuscript,
with the second paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus the struggle for the revision of the peace “Dictate” of Versailles
began at the moment when it was signed. In the program
of the National Socialist Labor Party of Adolf Hitler, this struggle
against the Versailles peace “Dictate” and for its revision assumed
a place far surpassing all other demands and considerations. It was
the leading thought by which the whole inner-political activity of
the Party was guided and which, after the seizure of power, was
to form the basis for all foreign political considerations and decisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One of the first fellow-fighters of Adolf Hitler was the Defendant
Rudolf Hess. Like Hitler, he was also a front-line soldier in the
first World War. As a volunteer he joined at the outbreak of the
war, and he had risen to the rank of infantry lieutenant when he
was wounded in Romania. Incapacitated for the infantry through
this wound, he enlisted in the Air Corps.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the armistice, he fought with various volunteer corps. But
in 1919, after the conclusion of the Versailles Peace Treaty, he had
to recognize that the victors did not really desire a peace based on
justice and a corresponding adjustment of interests. As could be
expected, the terms of the Peace Treaty of Versailles, and especially
the burden of the reparations on the already seriously affected
German economy, had to have...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, it may be difficult for you to cut
out of your speech the various references to the topics which I have
<span class='pageno' title='553' id='Page_553'></span>
referred to; but you must kindly try to do it. For if you continue
to refer to the topics to which I have referred, namely the justice
or the legality of the Treaty of Versailles, the Tribunal will have
to stop your speech and go on with some of the other defendants.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Mr. President, the subject I was just dealing with was
not a question of justice or legality but a question of the consequences
and referred to the investigation of the causal connection.
If the Prosecution, in weeks of presenting evidence, showed how
the rise of the National Socialist Party came about and how the
numbers of its mandates increased...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, those are all facts which the Prosecution
is perfectly entitled to prove. What you are now referring
to is an argument that certain clauses of the Versailles Treaty were
unjust. And that is an argument which the Tribunal is not prepared
to listen to. It is not a statement of fact; it is an argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Of course, it is an argument...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I have said that it is an argument we are
not going to listen to. If you do not understand what I mean, you
will have to stop continuing your speech. Do you understand that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Page 8, then, if you please.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in 1925 the Party was founded anew, Rudolf Hess was
once more one of the first...</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is impossible, Mr. President, to continue my speech, because all
the following statements are concerned with the question: What did
the Defendant Hess do up to the seizure of power? And I must say
and have said that the mainspring of his activity within the Party
and the German people consisted in achieving a revision of the
Versailles Treaty and its most unbearable terms. This is the very
question of the whole National Socialist movement up to 1933.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: If you confine yourself to statements of fact
as to what the Defendant Hess did, there will be no objection to it
at all. But as I said, if you make arguments that the Treaty of
Versailles is illegal or unjust, the Tribunal will not hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I shall continue, and I ask you, Mr. President, since
I do not know the exact limits which I may not transgress, to interrupt
me if I should again touch upon a subject which in the opinion
of the Tribunal refers to the justice of the Versailles Treaty and...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, you know perfectly well the limits
which have been laid down by the Tribunal many weeks ago as to
the question of the justice or the injustice of the Treaty of Versailles.
There has been a great number of documents rejected on
the ground that they dealt with the justice or the injustice of the
Treaty of Versailles, and you must have known that perfectly well.
<span class='pageno' title='554' id='Page_554'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I ask the Tribunal to tell me whether I am
permitted to make statements to the effect that the economic deterioration,
especially the great unemployment, resulted from the
reparations clauses of the Versailles Treaty and the refusal of the
victorious powers of 1919 to change this reparations policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You may certainly state what the condition
of Germany was. That is a matter of fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall again begin on Page 8.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When in 1925 the Party was founded anew...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Seidl, the Tribunal is perfectly familiar
with this type of argument; I mean, we are not going to lose sight
of the argument. We know all about the argument; we do not
want to hear it. We think it is entirely irrelevant.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Can’t you go on to other passages of your speech which are important
for the Defendant Hess? As I have said, there are a great
many matters of which evidence has been given by the Prosecution
and which have been answered by the Defense; and upon those
matters we desire to hear you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: I shall then begin on Page 10, with the second
paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, therefore, the National Socialist Party achieved a great victory
in the Reichstag elections of 14 September 1930, and entered the
new Reichstag with no less than 107 delegates, then that is at least
due to the economic crisis of the time, to the great unemployment
and so directly to the reparations stipulations, contrary to all
economic reason, of the Versailles Treaty and the refusal of the
victorious powers, in spite of urgent warnings, to agree to a revision.
It is true...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Dr. Seidl, you know that is
again an argumentative statement, that the Treaty of Versailles was
unfair and that the victorious powers had failed to recognize the
essential justice of Germany’s case or something of that sort. If you
can’t adjust your speech to what I have laid down, we shall have
to ask you to recast the whole speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. SEIDL: Then I shall turn to Page 11, second paragraph. No,
I shall turn to Page 12.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When the German people, in compliance with the Peace Treaty
of Versailles, had disarmed, it had a right to expect that the
victorious powers would also...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] One moment, Dr. Seidl, as you
don’t appear to be capable of recasting your speech as you go along
to accord to the Tribunal’s ruling, the Tribunal will not hear you
further at this stage. It will go on with the next defendant’s case.
<span class='pageno' title='555' id='Page_555'></span>
You will then have the opportunity of recasting your speech, and
you will submit your speech for translation before it is presented,
and I would explain that this is the reason why the Tribunal does
not propose to hear you upon these matters. They are irrelevant to
the issues that the Tribunal has to try. If they were in any way
relevant to the charges which are made against the defendants in
the Indictment, the Tribunal would of course hear them; but they
are, in the considered opinion of the Tribunal, in no way relevant
to the charges upon which the defendants are being tried and therefore
the Tribunal do not propose to hear them. The justice of the
Treaty of Versailles has nothing to do with whether or not the war
which was made by Germany was aggressive. It has nothing to do
with the war crimes with which the defendants are charged, and
therefore, it is irrelevant and for that reason we don’t propose to
hear it. Now, as I say, as you are unable apparently to recast your
speech, you will be given an opportunity of recasting it in private;
and you will then submit it for translation and you can then deliver
it. And now we will go on with the case against the Defendant
Ribbentrop. Dr. Horn, you are ready to go on, are you?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, I have just heard that the translations
are being brought up. Perhaps I may wait until the translation
gets here?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: I think you might go on. We can hear what
you say and take it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, Gentlemen of the Tribunal: “All great
upheavals in the history of the world, and especially of modern
Europe, have at the same time been wars and revolutions.”<a id='rA'/><a href='#fA' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[A]</span></sup></a></p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>We are in the midst of such an upheaval. It is by no means
concluded as yet. To select isolated events in order to submit them
to a judicial appraisal is not only almost impossible but entails the
danger of a premature judgment. Let us make no mistake about
it; we are not judging here a local crisis the causes of which are
limited to a certain part of Europe. We have to form a judgment
about a catastrophe which touches upon the deepest roots of our
civilization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has laid down strict measures in judging certain
national and international events. Germany is greatly interested
in the development of law and justice if its general application
leads to an improvement of international morals. This Tribunal has
the high task not only of passing judgment on certain defendants,
disclosing the causes of the present catastrophe, but at the same
time of creating norms which are expected to be adopted universally.
<span class='pageno' title='556' id='Page_556'></span>
No law should be created that is only applied to the weak. Otherwise
we would foster the danger that again all national efforts
would be directed to develop more fully the power of resistance
and thereby make war still more merciless than the one on which
judgment is to be rendered here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In taking these thoughts as a basis I beg to present to the Tribunal
the case which I represent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop is being considered among the conspirators
as the man mainly responsible for the foreign political and diplomatic
side of an alleged conspiracy, which is supposed to have had
as its goal the preparation and execution of aggressive wars. It is
my primary task to determine, on the basis of the results of the
evidence, when a case constitutes an attack in the meaning of international
law and in which cases aggressive wars were waged.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concept “aggressive war” is not exhausted in the proposed
formal judicial definition by the American and British prosecutors
but has, above all, a material basis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the knowledge of these premises permits the adoption of an
attitude which can serve as a basis for the decision of the Tribunal.
I am, therefore, deferring the discussion of the problematic aspects
of aggression and aggressive wars until, after having described the
German foreign policy and Herr Von Ribbentrop’s role therein, I
shall have submitted to the Tribunal the evidence for consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Tribunal intends to consider the matter in the light of
criminal law, I shall especially examine to what extent Herr Von
Ribbentrop hindered or furthered the foreign political decisions
during the time of his official activity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop’s first step into international politics and
his first move in the international game of power was successfully
accomplished when he concluded the Naval Agreement between
Germany and England in 1935. The circumstances under which this
treaty came into existence are as significant for the political
problems of those years as they are characteristic for judging the
personality of Von Ribbentrop and his further political development.
This treaty—as is known in informed quarters—came about under
exclusion of the official German diplomacy. The then German Ambassador
in London, Von Hoesch, and the Wilhelmstrasse were very
skeptical toward this project. Neither Hoesch nor the Wilhelmstrasse
believed that England was inclined toward concluding such
a treaty, which contradicted the terms of Part V of the Versailles
Treaty as well as her previous attitude as displayed at the different
disarmament conferences. Furthermore they did not believe that
such an agreement could materialize a few weeks after the Council
of the League of Nations had declared the restoration of German
<span class='pageno' title='557' id='Page_557'></span>
military sovereignty to be a breach of German obligations; and England,
France, and Italy had met at Stresa in order to counteract this
German step. And much less did they believe that a successful
conclusion of such a far-reaching treaty, with its fundamental
significance, could be achieved by an outsider like Herr Von
Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The consequences resulting from the conclusion of this treaty
were as significant as they were far-reaching. Herr Von Ribbentrop,
who came from the Party, rose greatly in Hitler’s esteem. In turn,
however, the relationship between Herr Von Ribbentrop and the
conservative diplomatic corps became more and more difficult. This
nominal ambassador who had managed to acquire Hitler’s confidence
was distrusted because his activity could not be controlled by the
Foreign Office.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From the conclusion of the Naval Agreement onwards, Hitler
began to see in Herr Von Ribbentrop the man who could help him
in the fulfillment of his pet wish—and also, we may say, of that of
the German people—to achieve a general political alliance with
England. The inclination to realize these intentions had practical
as well as ideal motives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The practical motives can be condensed into the short statement
that it is the misfortune of our nation and of all Europe that
Germany and England were never able to understand each other,
in spite of earnest attempts on the part of both countries during the
last 50 years. The ideal motives were grounded in Hitler’s indisputable
preference for many approved internal institutions of
the British Empire.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Politically the Naval Agreement represented the first important
break with the Versailles policy as sanctioned by England with the
final approval by France. And thus the first actual and practical
armament limitations were put in effect after many years of
fruitless negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Simultaneously with all these factors a generally favorable
political atmosphere was created. The Naval Agreement and its
effects may also have been the reason for Hitler to appoint Herr
Von Ribbentrop Ambassador to the Court of St. James the following
year, after the death of Hoesch.</p>

<p class='pindent'>However surprisingly fast Herr Von Ribbentrop succeeded in
concluding the Naval Agreement, in offering a general alliance to
England he had not the slightest success. Was it the fault of Herr
Von Ribbentrop’s diplomacy or the basic difference of interests?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whoever is familiar with Anglo-Saxon psychology knows that it
is not advisable to pester these people at once with proposals and
requests. Germans, at first sight, may recognize many common
<span class='pageno' title='558' id='Page_558'></span>
traits in the British, but upon closer observation profound differences
will be noted. Both nations have their roots in a different
soil. Their spiritual heritages have different sources. The deeper
the Germans and the British penetrate, the greater will appear the
difference in their faith and their mentality. The deeper the British
and the French penetrate into one another’s nature, the more they
will find in common with each other. These harmonies between the
British and the French were still further enhanced in the past
50 years through the affiliation of their political interests.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of modern history England has always had the
desire to ally herself with a continental military power and has
sought and found the fulfillment of this interest, depending on the
direction of British aims, sometimes in Vienna, sometimes in Berlin,
and from the beginning of the 20th century in Paris. England’s
interests, at the time of Herr Von Ribbentrop’s activity as Ambassador,
did not demand a departure from this line. This was
supported by the basic British attitude that Great Britain did not
wish to commit herself on the continent. From the Thames the
complications which lay dormant beneath the surface on the continent
were clearly seen. Added to this was the fact that authoritative
men in the Foreign Office were still thinking too much in
terms of a policy conducted at the turn of the 19th and the beginning
of the 20th century. This thinking was still, now as then, directed
towards an alignment with France.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The voices of those who advocated closer contact with Germany
were negligible, their political weight succumbed to that of the
opposition. To this were added the difficulties which resulted for
Herr Von Ribbentrop from Germany’s participation in the Non-Intervention
Committee, which at that time met in London in order
to keep the powers out of the Spanish civil war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution raised the question of how Herr Von Ribbentrop
regarded German-British relations on his departure from London
as Ambassador. The answer to this will best be furnished by
Document TC-75, which contains the views of Herr Von Ribbentrop
on the then prevailing foreign political situation of Germany and
on the future possibilities of German-British relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this, Herr Von Ribbentrop presupposes that Germany does not
want to bind herself to the <span class='it'>status quo</span> in Central Europe. It is his
conviction that the implementation of such foreign political aims
will necessarily force Germany and England “into different camps.”
For this reason he advises the formation of alliances, loose at first,
with powers having similar interests (Italy and Japan). Through
this policy he hopes to engage England at the danger points of her
Empire and still to keep the door open for an understanding with
Germany.
<span class='pageno' title='559' id='Page_559'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop then deals with the question of Austria
and the Sudetenland. According to his conviction at that time,
England will not in either of these questions give her consent to a
modification of the <span class='it'>status quo</span>, although she might be forced through
the power of circumstances to tolerate a solution of these questions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A change through collision with vital French interests of the
<span class='it'>status quo</span> in the East will, however, always cause England to
become an opponent of Germany in a conflict of such nature. Herr
Von Ribbentrop held this conviction not only in 1938 when this
document was penned; but, contrary to the assertions of the Prosecution,
warned Hitler of this danger even before and at the outbreak
of the second World War.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this document it follows also that Herr Von Ribbentrop
did not, as was asserted here, depict the British to Hitler as a
degenerate nation, for he says in this document quite clearly that
England would become a hard and keen opponent to the pursuance
of German interests in the Mediterranean.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This conception of Germany’s foreign political situation at that
time, as expressed in Document TC-75, evidently agreed with
Hitler’s ideas inasmuch as in the course of the Fritsch crisis Herr
Von Ribbentrop took over the Foreign Ministry in place of the
resigning Herr Von Neurath.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to Herr Von Ribbentrop’s testimony, Hitler asked him
upon entering his office to assist him in solving four problems.
These were the Austrian, the Sudeten German, the Memel, and
the Danzig and Corridor questions. As shown by the evidence this
was not a secret understanding which was arrived at by the two
statesmen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Party program contains, in Point 3, the demand for revision
of the peace treaties of 1919. In a number of speeches Hitler
repeatedly pointed out the necessity of fulfilling these German
demands. Reich Marshal Göring testified here that in November
1937 he explained to Lord Halifax the necessity of solving these
questions and said that they were an integral part of German
foreign politics. He also clearly expounded these goals to the French
Minister Bonnet. Herr Von Ribbentrop therefore put his energy into
the attainment of goals which were known and which beyond that
resulted, of necessity, from the dynamic situation at that time
prevailing in Central Europe due to the strengthening of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How much or how little freedom of action Herr Von Ribbentrop
had as a minister in the solution of these questions, I shall explain
in connection with my statement on the participation in the conspiracy
of which the defendant is accused. Only this much may be
said here: That, as was proven by evidence, with the dismissal of
Herr Von Neurath, the decisive authority in the field of foreign
<span class='pageno' title='560' id='Page_560'></span>
politics was also concentrated in Hitler’s hands. Herr von Neurath
was the last Foreign Minister who under the regime of National
Socialism at first retained a decisive influence on foreign politics as
a Foreign Minister, which influence, however, due to the increasing
power of the regime, he had to surrender more and more to Hitler’s
aspirations towards totality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the selection of Herr Von Ribbentrop, a man of Hitler’s own
liking became Foreign Minister. Outside of all formalities of state
law and jurisdiction, every government without a doubt has a strong
component in the purely personal relations among the rulers themselves.
Seen from this point of view, it is necessary for the understanding
of certain actions and of recent history to look into the
relations between Hitler and Herr Von Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop, a well-to-do man of nationalist leanings,
saw that Hitler and his Party strove for goals which corresponded
with his own ideas and feelings. Herr Von Ribbentrop’s ideas about
the foreign countries visited by him aroused Hitler’s interest.
Hitler’s personality and political convictions developed in Herr Von
Ribbentrop a form of loyalty, the final explanation of which one can
perhaps find in the effects of the power of suggestion and hypnosis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Let us not be oblivious to the fact that not only Herr Von Ribbentrop
but also countless people within and beyond Germany’s
borders fell victims to this power. What in this courtroom is to be
considered by the standards of law, after all finds its final explanation
only from the point of view of mass suggestion and
psychology, to say nothing of the pathological forms of these
phenomena. This task may be left to the sciences concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As an attorney—and only as such do I have to evaluate the
results of the evidence—I shall, with the permission of the Tribunal,
after clarifying this aspect, present the role of Herr Von Ribbentrop
within the alleged conspiracy for the plotting of wars and acts of
aggression in violation of treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop had not been Foreign Minister for 10 days
when he was called upon by Hitler to participate in the conference
with the Austrian Chancellor and his Foreign Minister on 12 and
13 February 1938 in Berchtesgaden. Evidence presented in court
has confirmed the fact that questions involving Austria especially
were exclusively Hitler’s own concern. The then Ambassador Von
Papen reported directly to the head of the State. Herr Von Ribbentrop
had no influence whatever upon the activities of the Party in
Austria nor in the Southeastern territory. My client alleges to have
been informed only very rarely and not officially about its activities
there.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The former Austrian Foreign Minister, Dr. Guido Schmidt,
testified here that Herr Von Ribbentrop did not participate in the
<span class='pageno' title='561' id='Page_561'></span>
decisive conference between Hitler and Schuschnigg. During the
other conferences he did not conduct himself in the Hitlerian “style”
and created the impression on the witness of not being informed,
which in a certain measure was due to his late activity in London
and his only recent appointment as Foreign Minister. From this
inoffensive conduct of Herr Von Ribbentrop the Prosecution have
drawn the conclusion that it was a maneuver agreed upon between
Hitler and himself. They insist upon seeing in Herr Von Ribbentrop’s
conduct a typical sign of what they characterize as “double
talk.” Must not the indisputable dates and facts with regard to Herr
Von Ribbentrop, the impression of the witness Schmidt resulting
therefrom, my portrayal of Ribbentrop’s position as Minister, his
lack of information on the long-planned preparations with respect
to Norway and Denmark, and other undeniably proven facts give
cause to raise the question whether Herr Von Ribbentrop did not
participate in decisions of foreign policy to a far lesser degree than
is contended by the Prosecution?</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the question of the Anschluss, at any rate, he did not, as the
evidence proves conclusively, play a decisive part. To him Austria
was a country, mutilated by the Treaty of St. Germain, which on
sound principles could hardly subsist and which once shared a
common destiny in history with a greater Germany. The National
Socialists were not the first to awaken Austria to the thought of a
union with Germany. This thought had ripened in the German
element of the Hapsburg monarchy since the revolution of 1848,
which aimed at a democratic Greater Germany. After the downfall
of the monarchy the Social Democrats continued to fight for it
for ideological and material reasons. In fact, they saw in the
Weimar state their spiritual offspring. The economic distress resulting
from the destruction of the Danube area as an economic entity
nurtured the thought of a union with the Reich, which was in a
better economic position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this fertile soil the National Socialists were able to cultivate
the Anschluss idea. In any event the prerequisites for an Anschluss
with Germany were created when support for Austria by Italy
ceased, due to the rapprochement of the latter toward Germany on
account of the Abyssinian conflict. The further reasons that contributed
to the Anschluss and its justification will be fully presented
by my colleague Dr. Steinbauer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Reich Marshal Göring testified here that the Anschluss in its
close form, as laid down in the Law of 13 March 1938, Wiedervereinigungsgesetz,
which was signed also by Herr Von Ribbentrop, did
not originally even correspond with Hitler’s intentions, but was put
through by him.
<span class='pageno' title='562' id='Page_562'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>As a further violation of treaties with regard to the Austrian
question the Prosecution quote the violation of Article 80 of the
Treaty of Versailles and the corresponding article of the Treaty of
St. Germain, as well as the violation of the treaty between Austria
and Germany of 11 July 1936.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The translation came through to me, I think,
as though you had said, “...the union did not even correspond with
the intentions of Hitler, but was put through”—it should have been
“by Göring himself.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Yes, I forgot that.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: In justification of these violations one could point
out that the articles concerned constituted a violation of the right
of self-determination, on which the peace treaties were based. The
outcome of the vote after the annexation at any rate clearly confirms
the Austrian attitude of that time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The <span class='it'>clausula rebus sic stantibus</span> could be considered as a further
justification for the violation. One could refer to the statement of
Under Secretary of State Butler in the House of Commons who, in
reply to a question after the Anschluss, stated that England had
given no special guarantee for the independence of Austria as laid
down in the Treaty of St. Germain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These legal evaluations would hardly do justice to the facts.
Statute law always lags behind the ideal of justice. That does not
only apply to domestic law but also to international law. Events
show that if treaties fail to make provision for changes, time and
events pass them by in order to rebuild them upon a new base.
The question of whether the participation in such events can be
legally evaluated must definitely be disputed. I shall refer later on
to the general aspects of the adaption of the law to the strength of
bare facts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An Englishman once asserted the following: “We have to face
the stubborn fact that Central Europe is populated by an almost
solid block of 80 million people who are highly gifted, highly
organized, and who are conscious of these achievements in the
highest degree. The majority of these people have the strong and
evidently incredible desire to be united in one state.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Anschluss of Austria and the nationalist theories of National
Socialism had set in motion this artificially split-up block created by
the peace treaties of 1919. No attentive observer could fail to notice
the effect of the Anschluss upon the neighboring states.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is not my intention to take up the time of the Tribunal with
the particulars of the subsequent efforts by the various groups of
Germans in the neighboring states for incorporation into the Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='563' id='Page_563'></span>
The facts which have now become history are only too well known.
My task here is to examine whether these events are the results of
a premeditated plan of one person or a group of persons, or whether
not rather a long and artificially suppressed force was instrumental
in accomplishing the objectives which were assigned to Herr Von
Ribbentrop by Hitler at the time of his appointment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Anschluss of Austria was the signal for the Sudeten German
Party to force the issue of an Anschluss now on their part too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop has been accused by the Prosecution of
having, in his capacity as Foreign Minister, engaged in creating
difficulties in collaboration with the Sudeten German Henlein. They
further accuse him of having induced the Sudeten German Party
to increase their demands step by step rather than enter the Czechoslovak
Government and of thus having prevented a solution of the
whole problem without making it appear that the German Government
was setting the pace.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Document 3060-PS submitted by the Prosecution shows just the
contrary. It is true that Herr Von Ribbentrop knew that the Anschluss
efforts of the Sudeten Germans were encouraged by the
Party. But he had no influence on this Party policy nor any
thorough knowledge of it. Due to the difficulties which had arisen
with the Czech Government on account of the separation efforts of
the Sudeten Germans and their partly uncontrollable policy, Herr
Von Ribbentrop considered it necessary to see to it that the realization
of the Sudeten German aims was carried out within the
limits of a responsible policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, wouldn’t that be a convenient time
to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: The Munich Agreement brought a temporary calm
in the situation with reference to foreign policy. The situation was
again complicated only by Hitler’s invitation to Hacha to come to
Berlin and by the events resulting from this visit. This step with
its far-reaching importance came as a complete surprise to Herr
Von Ribbentrop. Reich Marshal Göring has testified that after the
Slovakian question had been settled Hitler had, in spite of all
warnings, decided upon setting up the Protectorate of Bohemia and
Moravia. On the basis of the available material it will be difficult
to ascertain the final reasons for Hitler’s step. According to the
testimony of the Defendant Göring they sprang from Hitler’s constant
fear that through connections of the Czech officer corps with
Russia another complication of the situation in the southeastern
area might develop. This assumption and the resulting strategical
<span class='pageno' title='564' id='Page_564'></span>
and historical reasons may have induced Hitler to take this step of
13 March 1939, which came as a surprise to Herr Von Ribbentrop,
too.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This step, which is only understandable by Hitler’s tendency
towards surprise decisions, completely changed the German situation
as to foreign policy. Herr Von Ribbentrop had warned Hitler at that
time of the reaction by the Western Powers, and especially by
England, which had to be expected as a result of this step.</p>

<p class='pindent'>And the consequences became immediately apparent in the
Danzig and Corridor question which had been under discussion
since October 1938. Whereas up to that time the Poles, by reason
of the German policy since 1934 and due to the return of the
Olsa territory to Poland, had not refused discussions about this
problem, a reaction to the setting up of the Protectorate became
apparent immediately at the end of March. England regarded the
establishing of the Protectorate as a violation of the Munich Agreement
and began consultations with a number of countries. At the
same time Minister Beck, instead of coming to Berlin again, went
to London and returned from there with the assurance that England
would resist any change of the <span class='it'>status quo</span> in the East. This declaration
was also made in the House of Commons after previous consultation
with the French Government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On 26 March 1939 the Polish Ambassador Lipski called at the
Wilhelmstrasse and stated to Herr Von Ribbentrop that any continuation
of the revision policy toward Poland, especially as far as
a return of Danzig to the Reich was concerned, would mean war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thereby the Polish question had become a European question.
Herr Von Ribbentrop told the Polish Ambassador at that time that
Germany could not acquiesce to this decision. Only the reincorporation
of Danzig and an extraterritorial corridor to East Prussia
could bring a final solution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have submitted to the Tribunal, in the form of documentary
evidence, a review of the Polish crisis which then developed. I can
therefore assume that the actual course of events is known, including
the incorporation of the Memelland which returned to the Reich
through an agreement with Lithuania.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order not to take up the time of the Tribunal unnecessarily,
I shall confine myself to stating those facts which are apt to clarify
the role of Herr Von Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution accuses Herr Von Ribbentrop of mollifying
Poland by pretending friendly feelings toward her during the
Sudeten crisis and the setting up of the Protectorate of Bohemia
and Moravia. May I, in refutation of this assertion, point out that
the relations between Germany and Poland since the agreement of
1934 were good and even friendly and that this attitude became,
<span class='pageno' title='565' id='Page_565'></span>
of course, even more favorable through the fact that Poland was
indebted to German foreign policy for the acquisition of the Olsa
territory.</p>

<p class='pindent'>She had, therefore, every reason to entertain friendly feelings
toward Germany without it being necessary to be deceived by Herr
Von Ribbentrop’s behavior. As the evidence has shown, Herr Von
Ribbentrop continued this friendly policy towards Poland even after
the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, since there was no reason to
deviate from this attitude.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution further accuses Herr Von Ribbentrop of having
known that Hitler as early as the spring of 1939 was determined to
wage war against Poland and that Danzig served only as pretext for
this conflict. They deduce this from Documents USA-27 and USA-30.
These are Hitler’s well-known speeches of 23 May and 22 August
1939. First of all I wish to point out that Herr Von Ribbentrop was
not present at these conferences intended only for the military
leaders.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A number of key documents have been discussed in detail here.
I only wish to name the best known, such as the Hossbach Document,
the two Schmundt Files, and the afore-mentioned speeches.
Quite a number of statements about these documents have been
submitted in evidence. People who knew Hitler well stated that
they had become accustomed to his extravagant ideas expounded
in sudden speeches, in which he often repeated himself, and that
they did not take them seriously in view of his singularity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is possible to counter these documents with quite a number of
speeches in which Hitler has asserted the contrary. Here, conversely,
it might be pointed out that Hitler pursued some definite purpose
with his utterances. That may be quite true. But it is just as true
that even the few key documents which were submitted as proof
of aggressive war contain so many contradictions, with regard to
the aggressive intentions deduced from them, that at best a critic
judging retrospectively could recognize such intentions. Besides, the
contents of these documents, in accordance with the strict regulations
for secrecy, became known only to those who took part in
the conferences. This might explain why Herr Von Ribbentrop
learned about them only here in the courtroom.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The guiding principles as to foreign policy which Hitler laid
down for him at that time covered merely the reincorporation of
Danzig and the establishment of an extraterritorial road through
the Corridor, in order to open a direct land route to East Prussia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the Tribunal will remember, Hitler had told Herr Von
Ribbentrop already at the time of his appointment as Foreign
Minister that it was desirable to achieve these aims. This demand
was just as much historically justified as some solution in the case
<span class='pageno' title='566' id='Page_566'></span>
of earlier incorporations of areas inhabited by Germans, which had
become inevitable.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The statute of the purely German city of Danzig, which was
created by the Treaty of Versailles in the course of the establishment
of a Polish state, had always been the cause of friction
between Germany and Poland. Poland had achieved this solution
at Versailles through the argument that it needed an outlet to the
sea. For the same reason the Corridor was established against all
ethnological needs. Clemenceau in his memorandum already referred
to this artificial creation as a source of danger, especially due to
the fact that the peoples living in this area had been separated
through long years of bitter enmity. It was not difficult to foresee
that as a result of this fact the League of Nations and the International
Court at The Hague were constantly going to be occupied
with complaints about Polish violations of the agreement on minorities.
The same cause gave rise to the large-scale confiscation of
up to a million hectares of German estates and the expulsion of far
more than a million Germans in the course of 20 years. Not without
reason did Lord d’Abernon speak of the Danzig-Corridor
problem as the “powder magazine of Europe.” When finally a
solution of this question was sought under recognition of the Polish
claim to the preservation of an outlet to the sea, such an endeavor
appeared both sensible and historically justified.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The evidence has produced nothing to support the claim that
this question served merely as a pretext, which Herr Von Ribbentrop
could not but have known. It has produced no proof that Herr
Von Ribbentrop was acquainted with those of Hitler’s aims which
went far beyond these demands. Nor has it been proved that Herr
Von Ribbentrop, as has been asserted by the Prosecution, before
1 September 1939, did all he possibly could to prevent peace with
Poland, although he knew that a war with Poland would draw
Great Britain and France into the conflict. The Prosecution base
this statement on Document TC-73. This is a report by the Polish
Ambassador to Berlin, Lipski, to his Foreign Minister. The document
contains nothing whatsoever to substantiate this assertion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Moreover, I do not believe that, according to the result of the
evidence, Lipski can be valued as a particularly reliable witness.
May I recall that it was Lipski who, during the decisive stage of
the negotiations before the outbreak of the war, remarked that he
had not the least cause to be interested in notes or propositions
from the German side and that he knew the situation in Germany
quite well after a period of 5½ years as Ambassador. He was
convinced that in case of war riots would break out in Germany
and that the Polish Army would march victoriously into Berlin.
<span class='pageno' title='567' id='Page_567'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the testimony of the witness Dahlerus it was none
other than Lipski who, during the decisive discussion at the Polish
Embassy, created the impression among the Swedes that Poland was
sabotaging every possibility for negotiations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further results of the evidence also speak against the above
allegations presented by the Prosecution, as for instance the fact
that Herr Von Ribbentrop, after he had learned that the Polish-English
guarantee pact had been signed, intervened with Hitler to
cancel the order for the Armed Forces to march because a conflict
with Poland would also, in his opinion, have drawn in the Western
Powers. This opinion coincides with the conclusions to which Herr
Von Ribbentrop had come in his review of the European situation
and laid down in Document TC-75, which has already been mentioned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Minister Schmidt has testified here that it was Herr Von Ribbentrop
who, on 25 August 1939, after the Hitler-Henderson meeting,
sent him to Sir Nevile Henderson with the verbal communiqué,
presented as TC-72/69, in which the contents of Hitler’s proposals
were summarized. At the same time Herr Von Ribbentrop adjured
Henderson to submit Hitler’s proposals personally to the British
Government for favorable consideration. According to the <span class='it'>British
Blue Book</span>, Sir Nevile Henderson could not refrain from calling
these and subsequent proposals exceptionally reasonable and sincere.
They were not the customary Hitler proposals, but pure “League
of Nations” proposals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>No one studying the negotiations of the subsequent fateful days
can deny that everything was done on the German side at least to
get negotiations under way on a workable basis. The opposite side
did not let it come to that, because they were determined to take
action this time. The good services of England ended with the
breaking-off of all mediation without having been able to bring
Poland to the conference table.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop has been blamed for having practically
defeated the purpose of the last decisive discussion with the British
Ambassador, Henderson, by having read the German proposals to
Poland so fast, contrary to all diplomatic custom and international
courtesy, that Sir Nevile Henderson could not understand them
and, hence, could not pass them on. The interpreter, Minister
Schmidt, was present at this decisive discussion. He has testified
here under oath that this statement is not true. One may consider
Hitler’s order to acquaint Sir Nevile Henderson only with the substance
of the memorandum as unwise. The fact is that not only
did Herr Von Ribbentrop read the entire contents at a normal speed
to the British Ambassador; but he also, by having the interpreter
present, made it possible for Sir Nevile Henderson to become
<span class='pageno' title='568' id='Page_568'></span>
familiar with the entire contents and, moreover, to have explanations
given on it. Besides, upon the initiative of Reich Marshal
Göring, it was transmitted to the British Embassy during the same
night by telephone to the Counsellor of the Embassy, Mr. Forbes.
Thus the British Government should have been able to render the
good services offered for opening negotiations based on positive
proposals.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By reason of these facts here deposed, one must rightly doubt
the truth of the allegation that the defendant had done everything
to prevent peace with Poland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of my defense speech I stressed that legal considerations
concerning aggressive war are not possible without
knowledge of the circumstances leading to an armed conflict. Before
I proceed to the legal aspects of the conflict with Poland, may I
make some additional statements concerning the causes that led
to the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The period between two World Wars is characterized by the
conflicting reactions of those powers which were satisfied and those
which were dissatisfied. It seems to be an inevitable law that after
great war repercussions, the victorious states tend as far as possible
toward the re-establishment of the prewar status and prewar mentality,
whereas the vanquished are forced to find a way out of the
consequences of their defeat by new means and methods. Thus
after the Napoleonic wars there came about the Holy Alliance which
under Metternich’s leadership, using legitimacy as an authorization,
tried to ignore the effects of the French Revolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What the Holy Alliance did not achieve, the League of Nations
equally failed to achieve.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Created in an atmosphere of fervent belief in human progress,
it was quickly transformed into a tool of the satisfied states. Every
effort to strengthen the League of Nations meant a new bulwark
for the maintenance of the <span class='it'>status quo</span>. Under cover of the elegant
diction of juridical formalities power politics continued. Besides,
the obsession by the idea of <span class='it'>sécurité</span> soon deprived the newly-created
body of any breath of freshness and life.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this fashion, naturally, a solution of the problems created by
the end of the first World War could never be found. In international
relations a coalition of interests of the conservative powers content
with the <span class='it'>status quo</span> and of the revolutionary powers trying to do
away with it, became increasingly apparent. It could only be a
question of time until under those circumstances the political initiative
would pass to the dissatisfied powers. The formation of this
front depended exclusively on the force of the revolutionary spirit
<span class='pageno' title='569' id='Page_569'></span>
which was crystallizing in opposition to the political self-complacency
and hankering after the past. In this fertile soil grew the
doctrines of National Socialism, Fascism, and Bolshevism, obscure
in many parts of their programs, elastic and incoherent in others.
Their power of attraction was based not so much on their programs
but on the fact that they admittedly offered something new and that
they did not exhort their followers to worship a political ideal that
had failed in the past.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The economic crisis of the postwar period, the controversies
about reparations and the occupation of the Ruhr, the inability of
democratic governments to obtain anything for their distressed
peoples from the other democracies, unavoidably led to a test of the
doctrines which had not yet been tried out. The practical results of
this revolution, as we experienced them in Germany after 1933,
could, aside from the social program, consist only in abolishing the
peace settlement of 1919, which constitutes a classical example of
failure to understand the revolutionary character of a world crisis.
For this revolution these tasks were not legal questions but doctrines,
exactly as it had long become a doctrine of the satisfied states
to maintain the <span class='it'>status quo</span> at all costs, even at the price of a new
world war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only he who does not shut his eyes before these facts can judge
the political crisis of the past decade.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every revolution has but two possibilities; either it meets so
little resistance that eventually conservative tendencies develop and
an amalgamation with the old order is formed, or the antagonistic
forces are so strong that finally the revolution breaks up through
overstraining its own means and methods.</p>

<p class='pindent'>National Socialism went the second way, which began without
bloodshed and partly with a remarkable leaning upon tradition. But
this method, too, could not escape the inherent laws of history. The
aims were too high for one generation, the revolutionary essence too
strong. The initial successes were startling, but they also resulted
in lack of criticism as to the methods and aims. The process of
uniting all larger German groups in the Central European space
would most probably have succeeded, if at the end—I am referring
to the setting up of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and
the pursuit of the Danzig-Corridor question—the revolutionary
tempo and methods had not been overstrained by reason of previous
successes. No person capable of sober judgment will dispute the
need for a solution of the Danzig-Corridor question, delicate
as it was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution may assert that in reality Danzig was but a
pretext, but seen from the state of affairs in 1939 this can hardly be
<span class='pageno' title='570' id='Page_570'></span>
proved. But it is certain that the opposite side was concerned about
other things than the maintenance of the <span class='it'>status quo</span> in the East.
National Socialism, and with it, in its newly gained strength, the
German Reich, had become such a danger in the eyes of the others
that after Prague it was determined to make any further German
advance a “test case,” wherever it should happen.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already said that the revolutionary protest in Central
Europe was chiefly due to economic causes brought about by Versailles
where a peace treaty was imposed on Germany of which it
was well-known that its economic provisions could not be carried
out by the vanquished.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Horn, the Tribunal thinks that sentence,
at any rate, is objectionable on the ground that I have already
stated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, I did not mean to emphasize how the
Versailles Treaty came about; I only wanted to stress certain
necessary consequences which are generally known facts. But I
have completed this part and have nothing further to say with
reference to it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on, Dr. Horn.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Much has been said here about the slogan Lebensraum.
I am convinced that this word would never have become a
political program, if after the first World War Germany had been
given the possibility of linking up with the world markets, instead
of being strangled economically. By systematically cutting her off
from all raw material bases of the world—all this for reasons of
<span class='it'>sécurité</span>—the tendency towards autarchy, the inevitable way out
from the barring from the world markets was fostered; and, at the
same time, with the progressively deteriorating economic situation,
the cry for Lebensraum could find receptive ears.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, Stalin is right when he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“It would be erroneous to believe that the second World War
came about accidentally or as a result from mistakes of one
or the other of the statesmen, even though such mistakes were
made without doubt. Actually the war came about as an
inevitable result of the development of international economic
and political forces based on modern monopolistic capitalism.”<a id='rB'/><a href='#fB' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[B]</span></sup></a></p>

Mr. Justice Jackson is trying in this connection to invoke Article 4 of the
Weimar Constitution of 1919. According to this, the universally recognized rules
of international law are regarded as binding components of German Reich law.
Owing to the differing legal appreciation of the Kellogg Pact on the part of the
Great Powers the interpretation advanced by the Prosecution cannot be looked
upon as German Reich law.</p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>Even though war has been previously declared an international
crime, especially at the 8th League of Nations Assembly of 1927, it
became quite clear in preliminary conversations, as has been proved
by documents already submitted to the Tribunal, that this declaration
was not meant to make war a crime in the legal sense but that
it was an expression of the wish to prevent future international
catastrophes of the scale of the first World War. Moreover, neither
the United States nor Russia participated in the League of Nations
resolution of 1927.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All further plans for outlawing war during the period between
the first and second World Wars remained mere drafts, as the British
Prosecutor had to acknowledge in his significant argumentation,
because practical politics could not follow these moral postulates.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All these experiments—and they are by no means few—clearly
show that the problem of finding a definition lies in the difficulty of
condensing a political process, dependent upon a host of components,
into a legal concept which will cover all the varying cases occurring
in practice. The failure to formulate a definition which could be
used in international law has led to the fact that, instead of working
out general standards and measures applicable in each case, the
designation of the aggressor was left to the decision of an organ
dominating all the contending parties. In such a way, the question
of defining the aggressor became the question: “<span class='it'>Quis judicavit?</span>”
that is, “Who shall designate the aggressor?” From this decision
follows a new difficulty, namely, what is to be done against the
aggressor?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Previous to the attempt of settling in a general way the concept
of aggression and the sanctions against the aggressor, political
alliances determined the obligations of the parties to wage war. In
order to improve this unsatisfactory and anarchic situation, the
United States, under Secretary of State Bryan...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] Isn’t this really arguing the
same questions that Dr. Jahrreiss has already argued?
<span class='pageno' title='572' id='Page_572'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, I have tried to omit the matters set
forth by Professor Jahrreiss. Professor Jahrreiss confined his
arguments chiefly to the Kellogg Pact. I am only dealing with the
questions pertaining to the legal aspect of wars of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Yes, but the Tribunal only granted the right
to have an additional counsel deal with the general questions of law
on the understanding that the other counsel were not going to deal
with the same questions of law. Of course, you are not using the
words of Dr. Jahrreiss—I should not expect you to do that—but you
are arguing the very same topics.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, it had been agreed originally, as the
professor as an expert had stated, that every counsel is entitled to
take a different attitude toward the problem argued by him. Professor
Jahrreiss concentrated chiefly on the Kellogg Pact and its consequences.
I personally am turning my attention to aggressive war,
and, as you, Mr. President, emphasized...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just a moment. What is involved, then, is that
the Tribunal is going to hear 20 arguments upon the general questions
of law; and surely it can scarcely have been thought by
defendants’ counsel that the Tribunal proposed to hear 20 arguments
on the general questions of law and also hear Dr. Jahrreiss
on it. The only purpose of hearing one counsel was to have the
general questions of law dealt with by one counsel alone, and that
the others should not speak upon it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: Mr. President, may I emphasize once more...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Just a moment. The Tribunal will adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. RUDOLF DIX (Counsel for Defendant Schacht): My Lord,
may I ask the Tribunal to accept a short explanation to the matter
which has just taken up the attention of the Tribunal and which for
most counsel is of general and fundamental importance. I should
like to remind you of the fact that the suggestion and initiative to
take up certain legal topics and have them dealt with by Professor
Jahrreiss came from the Defense and that this suggestion was made
for the sole reason of complying with the Tribunal’s wish to expedite
the proceedings. I must earnestly request the Tribunal to protect us
from letting this suggestion, made to and granted by the Tribunal
at the time, become our own pitfall in that a resolution which has
been made is interpreted too strictly. I do not have the resolution
before me and I do not intend to deal with it and discuss it, but I
should like to say this: Professor Jahrreiss did speak and was to
<span class='pageno' title='573' id='Page_573'></span>
speak on but two topics which, it is true, were of a general nature;
that is, (a) the punishment of individuals for a war of aggression,
in other words, <span class='it'>nulla poena sine lege</span>, and (b) the legal nature of the
Führer decrees. Only these two problems were to be dealt with by
Dr. Jahrreiss and these were the two topics that he actually did
deal with. But besides that, these proceedings entail a series of legal
problems which are of a general nature and more or less affect each
of the defendants. I only recall to you the interpretation of the
conspiracy charges, the various questions dealing with international
law, the questions of hostages and forced labor, and the legal question
concerning distress at sea through naval warfare, and other
general questions. There are a host of general questions, and above
all the matter on which my colleague, Dr. Horn, was stopped, concerning
the question: “What is an aggressive war?” There exist
fundamental differences between a military war of aggression, a
political war of aggression, and a juridical war of aggression,
<span class='it'>et cetera</span>, about which Dr. Jahrreiss did not say a single word, nor
was he supposed to do so. And please—I trust you do not mind my
saying so, but that is the way I understood Dr. Horn—that is really
the basis of his argument.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not propose to argue and to refer to a resolution; but I ask
the Tribunal not to put us in a most delicate situation, namely, that
we, in order to expedite the proceedings by having Professor
Jahrreiss deal with a number of legal questions, be put in a position
for which we cannot take responsibility, in that we are prevented
from dealing with certain questions which in our opinion are of
decisive legal importance to the defendants and about which
Jahrreiss himself did not speak at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only a word or two more. I believe the Tribunal will agree with
me that one can have an entirely different opinion on the subject
with which Professor Jahrreiss has dealt. I do not have it; nor shall
I contradict Dr. Jahrreiss. But from a purely theoretical point of
view that might be possible. Should it happen, just because in such
an important matter a speaker has dealt with this question, although
in a sense which possibly one of the counsel considers entirely
improper and harmful to his case, that that counsel is forced to
keep silent on such a matter? That cannot have been the intention
of the Tribunal. Well, all I wanted to say was this: This speech by
Jahrreiss served the purpose of expediting the Trial. Well and good.
But we ask—I think I may say “we”; I believe that none of my
colleagues is of a different opinion—we ask that it should not be
interpreted too formally; and if one of us for some good reason says,
“I have to discuss this, it is important for this or that reason,” to
give us that possibility wherever Jahrreiss has dealt with the
subject in a sense which we do not approve, and not to prevent the
<span class='pageno' title='574' id='Page_574'></span>
discussion of some general legal question if it should be raised by
any of the counsel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The Tribunal has been considering this
matter and they are fully aware, of course, of the difficulties which
may possibly arise if there were differences of opinion among the
defendants’ counsel upon questions which had been dealt with by
Dr. Jahrreiss. They did anticipate when they made the order which
specifies that Dr. Jahrreiss should speak on legal issues arising out
of the Indictment and Charter which are common to all the defendants—those
are the words of the order—that he would deal with all
the issues which were common to all the defendants, and in the
absence of some difference of opinion, that the other defendants
would be prepared to adopt his argument; but the Tribunal think
that the questions of law may be to some extent quite various and
difficult and that the only rule which is possible for them to lay
down at this stage is that there must be no real repetition by
defendants’ counsel. The Tribunal apprehends that defendants’
counsel will see the necessity for such a rule as that. It cannot be
in the interests of an expeditious trial that argument should be
repeated over and over again, and this Tribunal desires to point out
to the defendants’ counsel that such repetition upon general matters
only tends to distract the attention of the Tribunal from the real
defenses of the clients whom they represent, and therefore the
Tribunal hopes that the defendants’ counsel will try to co-operate
in this matter and confine such legal arguments as they think it
right to present to the Tribunal to arguments which had not been
addressed to the Tribunal by counsel who preceded them—either
Dr. Jahrreiss or any other counsel. That is all that I need to say,
I think, at this stage; and as it is now 5 o’clock the Tribunal will
adjourn.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal adjourned until 8 July 1946 at 1000 hours.</span>]</h3>

<div><span class='pageno' title='575' id='Page_575'></span><h1><span style='font-size:larger'>ONE HUNDRED AND SEVENTY-THIRD DAY</span><br/> Monday, 8 July 1946</h1></div>

<h2 class='nobreak'><span class='it'>Morning Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>MARSHAL: May it please the Tribunal, Defendant Fritzsche is
reported absent.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: With the permission of the High Tribunal I shall
continue with my final presentation, beginning with Page 34. The
English text page number corresponds with the German text page
number.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Previous to the attempt to settle, in a general way, the concept
of aggression and sanctions against aggressors, political alliances
determined the obligations of the parties to wage war. In order to
improve this unsatisfactory and anarchic situation, the United States,
under Secretary of State Bryan, took the initiative in a series of
separate treaties in order to reach an agreement for periods of
respite, which were meant to delay the outbreak of hostilities and
to allow the passions to cool down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Covenant of the League of Nations took up this point of view
but went one decisive step further by determining a procedure by
which the League organs should determine the permissibility or
nonpermissibility of war. The decision indicated whether war
was permitted or not according to the Covenant. The aim of this
regulated procedure was to hit the disturber of international order,
who was not necessarily identical with the aggressor. The state
which went to war in accordance with the decision of the League
of Nations organs behaved in a lawful way, even when it undertook
preliminary hostilities and thereby was the aggressor in the
military sense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was therefore apparent that the distinction between aggressor
and attacked was not adequate enough to guarantee a just settlement
of international relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although these Covenant regulations and the procedure based
thereon showed that the relation of lawful to unlawful, permitted
to prohibited, aggressor to attacked, was unsatisfactory, efforts were
still made to brand as an aggressor anyone who offended against
international order. As the essential decision miscarried owing to
the difficulties just mentioned, there was an attempt to make out
<span class='pageno' title='576' id='Page_576'></span>
of this legal concept, which did not allow a concise definition, a
political decision by those organs of the League of Nations which
were qualified for maintaining international order. Such was the
case in the draft of a mutual assistance agreement elaborated in
1923 by order of the League of Nations Assembly. The Geneva
Protocol, which was meant to supplement the Covenant inadequacies
concerning the question of the settlement of disputes, also transferred
to the League of Nations Council the decision of determining
who had violated the agreement and was therefore the aggressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All other attempts to outlaw war and settle conflicts, mentioned
by the British Chief Prosecutor, have remained drafts, excepting the
Kellogg Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It can probably be put down to this fact that the idea of a legal
definition of the aggressor was once more taken up at the Disarmament
Conference. In this way the definition was established in the
year 1933 by the committee for questions of security, presided over
by the Greek, Politis, of the general Disarmament Conference committee.
Owing to the failure of this conference, the definition was
made the object of a series of separate treaties at the London conferences
in the same year. The only great power participating was
the Soviet Union, which had taken the initiative to obtain the
definition at the disarmament conference. This definition has also
been adopted by the United States Chief Prosecutor, who has based
thereon the Indictment before this Tribunal for a Crime against
Peace. This definition is no more than a proposal of the Prosecution
within the limits of the Charter, which does not give further
details about the concept of a war of aggression. It must be
emphasized that Mr. Justice Jackson cannot invoke in this matter
any universally acknowledged principle of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The report of the 1933 commission did not become the object of
a general treaty, as projected, but was merely agreed upon between
a number of individual parties in agreements binding only those
concerned. As a matter of fact, the only agreements were those
between the Soviet Union and a number of states around her. No
other great power accepted the definition. In particular, Great
Britain kept aloof, notwithstanding the fact that the individual
agreements mentioned were actually signed in London. At least the
participation of the great powers would have been required for the
constitution of a principle of international law of such far-reaching
importance for the reorganization of international relations.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Quite apart from this legal consideration, the utterances of the
British and the American Chief Prosecutors show that, as far as
facts are concerned, the proposal is equally unsatisfactory. In the
important question of Point 4 of the definition, the British Prosecution
differs from the American. The old conflict of interests
<span class='pageno' title='577' id='Page_577'></span>
between <span class='it'>mare liberum</span> and <span class='it'>mare clausum</span> had led the Prosecution
to the point that Sir Hartley Shawcross did not mention the naval
blockade of the coasts and ports of a state as aggressive action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The definition of 1933 may offer valuable characteristics for
establishing the aggressor, but one does not get around the fact
that a formal legal definition shows the impossibility of doing
justice to all actual political cases.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the attempt to set down a new regulation for creating order
in the world in the Charter of the United Nations, one returned,
having obviously recognized this truth, to the idea of a decision by
an international organ without wanting to force its judgment into
the inconvenient form of a rigid definition. The Charter of Peace
of San Francisco says, in Chapter VII, Article 39:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The Security Council shall determine the existence of any
threat to world peace and security or breach of the peace or
act of aggression and shall make recommendations or decide
what measures shall be taken to maintain or restore international
peace and security.”</p>

</div>

<p class='noindent'>In the year 1939 there was neither a recognized definition of
the term aggressor nor an institution authorized to designate the
aggressor.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The League of Nations as an instrument for the settlement of
disputes had completely failed. This was expressed outwardly
already by the fact that three great powers had left it. How little
the mutilated League of Nations was taken notice of in international
life, was shown by the attitude of the Soviet Union in the Finnish
question. She did not take into consideration in any way the decision
of the League of Nations with regard to this conflict but pursued
her own interests in her dealings with Finland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If now, after these statements, I make a proposal to the Court
as to what should be understood by the concept of attack in Article
6(a) of the Charter, this qualification cannot be related to a
definition recognized in international law. There is nothing left but
adherence to the interpretation which the practice of states and the
traditions of diplomacy are wont to give.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the conception prevailing in the year 1939, the
outbreak of war, in whatever way it happened, was not legally
appraised. The Kellogg Pact and the negotiations following it have
not been able to abolish this fact, which was a result of centuries
of development. This is deeply to be regretted, but one cannot
ignore reality. The fact that this opinion, when war broke out, is
in accordance with the conception of international law of the main
participating powers that had signed the Charter, follows from the
fact that men of international reputation in the field of international
<span class='pageno' title='578' id='Page_578'></span>
law were of the opinion that, should the Kellogg Pact and the system
of collective security fail, the traditional legal conception as to war
was still valid.<a id='rD'/><a href='#fD' style='text-decoration:none'><sup><span style='font-size:0.9em'>[D]</span></sup></a></p>

<hr class='footnotemark'/>

<p class='pindent'>Should Herr Von Ribbentrop really have had the opinion in 1939
that his acts, measured by traditional diplomatic technique, would
be considered as a crime punishable by international law?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have already pointed out that generally, and therefore also
by Herr Von Ribbentrop, the then existing frontier line in the
East was considered untenable in the long run and therefore in
need of adjustment. The Peace Conference at Versailles, by satisfying
the Polish demands when this state was newly created,
created problems which could not be solved by international co-operation
in the time between the two World Wars. These frontiers
could never be guaranteed within the framework of European
pacts. A guarantee for the Eastern frontier created by Versailles
could not be reached within the framework of the Locarno Treaties
because of the opposing interests of the participating powers,
whereas it was arrived at for the Western frontiers. All that
was achieved after endless efforts was arbitration treaties, in
connection with the Locarno system, between Germany and Poland
and Germany and Czechoslovakia. They did not contain any guarantees
for frontiers, but only a procedure for settling litigations.
I shall deal with them when I come to the various violations of
treaties of which Herr Von Ribbentrop is accused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After Hitler had also expressed his distrust towards collective
security by leaving the Disarmament Conference and the League
of Nations, he went over to the system of bilateral treaties. In
this connection, at the negotiations preparatory to the agreements
between Germany and Poland of 1934, it was clearly stated that
a solution of the problems between the two states should be found
in the spirit of the treaty. We will not suppress here that only
peaceful means were considered for this arbitration and a 10-year
nonaggression pact was concluded. Whether Hitler believed
honestly in the possibility of solving this problem or hoped to
change the untenable situation in the East by means of evolution
is of no importance for the forming of an opinion on Herr Von
Ribbentrop’s behavior. He did not take any initiative in this step
but found this agreement an existing political and legal fact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The experience made in the adjustment of interests of states
teaches that agreements are durable only when they correspond
to political realities. If that is not the case, the force of facts oversteps,
of itself, the original intention of the contracting parties.
A great statesman of the nineteenth century has expressed this truth
<span class='pageno' title='579' id='Page_579'></span>
by saying, “The element of political interest is an indispensable
foundation of written treaties.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, the Eastern question was not removed by the agreement
of 1934 but continued to burden international relations. As shown
by the evidence, it became more and more clear in the course of
political evolution that sooner or later solutions of some kind
had to be sought. Both the statute of the Free City of Danzig,
which was in contradiction with ethnological, cultural, and economic
facts, and the isolation of East Prussia through the creation
of a corridor, had brought about causes for conflict, which a number
of statesmen feared as far back as Versailles.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Taking into consideration such a state of affairs, the British
Declaration of Guarantee to Poland of 21 March 1939, enlarged
on 25 August 1939 into the Mutual Aid Agreement, sufficed in case
of the appearance of a possibility of conflict with this country,
to make the Poles averse, from the very start, to a sensible revision
even on a modest scale.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This Declaration of Guarantee shows once more to how great
an extent Great Britain, taking a sensible political view, drew
conclusions from the decline of the collective security system and
what little confidence she had in the practical results of the moral
condemnation of war through the Kellogg Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop had, therefore, to draw the conclusion
from the behavior of Great Britain that the attitude of the Polish
Government, from which Germany was entitled to expect some
concession, was bound to become rigidly inflexible. The developments
during the following months proved this conclusion to be
right.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The entry of the Soviet Union into the conflict shows, in particular,
that the coming danger would develop within the compass
of the traditional principles of politics and the realization by each
state of its own interests. The Soviet Union, too, had in her turn
left the ground of the collective security system. She looked at the
approaching conflict from the viewpoint of Russian interests
exclusively. In considering this state of affairs Herr Von Ribbentrop
took pains at least to localize the threatening conflict, if it
could not be avoided. He had every reason to hope for success
in this endeavor, as both the powers mainly interested in Eastern
Europe, the Soviet Union and Germany, concluded not only the
Non-Aggression and Friendship Agreement previous to the outbreak
of armed hostilities but simultaneously came to terms, by
way of a secret agreement, concerning the future fate of the territory
of Poland and the Baltic countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Nevertheless, the machinery of the mutual aid agreements was
set going, and thereby the local Eastern European conflict became
<span class='pageno' title='580' id='Page_580'></span>
a world conflagration. If the Prosecution want to apply a legal
standard to these happenings, they cannot do so without taking
into consideration the Soviet Union from the point of view of
partnership.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through the participation of Great Britain and France, the
conflict in Eastern Europe grew into a European one, inevitably
followed by the universal war. The entry in the war of the powers
mentioned took place according to the form provided by the Third
Hague Convention concerning the opening of hostilities, that is,
an ultimatum with a conditional declaration of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the session of 19 March 1946, Mr. Justice Jackson, interpreting
the Indictment, stressed the point that the extension of
the war brought about by the Western Powers did not constitute
a punishable aggression on the side of Germany. This interpretation
is in keeping with his general argument concerning the
concept of aggression. If he wished to carry this through quite
consistently, he would logically have to declare Great Britain and
France aggressors against Germany for having brought about the
state of war by means of the ultimatum.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe I am in agreement with the Prosecution when I express
the supposition that such a result would not meet with its approval.
The Prosecution have presented their evidence in such a way as
to enter into the political-historical background of the war. They
have accordingly not been satisfied with relying on the formal
legal definition or any single criterion thereof. They herewith
confirm my conclusion, presented by me to the Court, that the
definition proposed by the Prosecution is no suitable basis for
the qualification of the indeterminable concept of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I confirm, according to events at the outbreak of the war,
the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Kellogg Pact and the concept of aggression, the Prosecution’s
pillars, do not sustain the Indictment. The Kellogg Pact had no
legally conceived substance for states, much less for individuals.
The attempt to put life into it afterwards by means of a formal
concept of aggression was frustrated by political reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop’s share in the extension of the conflict to
Scandinavia was so small that it hardly can be laid to his charge
as an individual action.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The interrogations of the witnesses Grossadmiral Raeder and
Field Marshal Keitel have shown beyond doubt that as a matter
of fact Herr Von Ribbentrop was informed of this operation for
the first time only 36 hours in advance. His contribution was
solely the elaboration of notes prescribed to him in content and form.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the actual facts, namely the imminent violation of
Scandinavian neutrality by the Western Powers, he was limited to
<span class='pageno' title='581' id='Page_581'></span>
the information communicated to him. The evidence has shown,
and I shall set forth later in legal argument, that he as Minister
for Foreign Affairs was not competent to check this information
and that he did not possess any actual means to do so. Presuming
that this information was true, he could justly assume that the
German Reich behaved in the intended action quite in accordance
with international law. I leave more detailed argument concerning
this point of law to my colleague, Dr. Siemers, well conversant
with this point, whose client, Grossadmiral Raeder, had submitted
to Hitler a large amount of enemy information and the proposal
for a German occupation of Scandinavia.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the case of Belgium and the Netherlands it has been proved
by evidence that unlimited maintenance of the neutrality of the
Belgian-Dutch territory by these countries themselves could not
be guaranteed. Even previous to the war there existed between
the General Staffs of the Western Powers and those of both neutral
countries agreements and constant exchange of practical knowledge
concerning tactics and occupation in case of a conflict with Germany.
Detailed deployment plans and fortification systems built under
supervision of officers detached for that purpose by the Western
Powers were meant to prepare the reception of Allied forces. These
projects included not only co-operation of the armies concerned, but
also the assignment of certain civilian authorities to assist in the
supply and the advance of the Allies.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Important about these preparations is the fact that they were
made not only for the case of defense, but also for the offensive.
For this reason Belgium and the Netherlands could not or would
not defend themselves against British bomber formations continuously
flying over them, with the immediate aim of destroying the
Ruhr district, the Achilles heel of the German war industry. This
area was also the main goal of the Allies for an offensive on land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These intentions as well as most intensive preparations for offensive
measures by the Western Powers had been ascertained beyond
a doubt through sources of information. The grouping of the offensive
forces showed that the Belgian-Dutch territory was included
in the theater of operations. As has already been described in connection
with preceding cases of conflict, such information was
continuously passed on to Herr Von Ribbentrop by Hitler or his
deputies. Here, too, Herr Von Ribbentrop had to rely upon the
accuracy of this information without having the right or the duty
of checking it. In that way he, too, became convinced that in order
to avert a deadly danger, namely, an Allied thrust into the Ruhr
district, preventive countermeasures were necessary. On the basis
of these considerations, Luxembourg could not be spared because of
the extensiveness of modern military operations.
<span class='pageno' title='582' id='Page_582'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this procedure the Prosecution accuses, among
other things, German foreign policy and thereby Herr Von Ribbentrop,
of having committed an invasion in contradiction to the Fifth
Hague Treaty concerning the rights and duties of neutral powers
and persons in case of war on land.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution overlook that this treaty does not refer to
drawing a neutral into a war between other powers but deals only
with the rights and duties of neutrals and belligerents as long as
a state of neutrality exists. The Prosecution have made the mistake
of applying their, as I have shown, erroneous interpretation of the
Kellogg Pact, to the pact which had been made 20 years earlier. There
remains no doubt that at the time of the Second Hague Peace Conference
the outbreak of war was a fact of historical value and not
subject to any law. All treaties concerning laws of war, especially
the Rules of Land Warfare and the Neutrality Pact for Land and
Sea Warfare, rest upon the basis of an existing state of war, hence
do not regulate the <span class='it'>jus ad bellum</span>, but the <span class='it'>jus in bello</span>. This fact
disposes of the Prosecution’s references to the Fifth Hague Agreement
in all cases of the expansion of war as concerns neutrals which
have ratified this treaty.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is, moreover, quite doubtful whether the Locarno Treaty can
be referred to, as was done by the Prosecution, in connection with
drawing Belgium into the war. With Germany’s resignation in 1935
the Locarno system had collapsed, as will be shown by the defense
counsel of Baron von Neurath. All attempts to effect a new agreement
which was to take its place were based on the fact that the
actual situation created by Germany must be taken as the starting
point for a new agreement. This is shown especially by the British
and French plans for the intended new agreement. The attempt to
create a new agreement was not successful. However, the thorough
and wearisome negotiations show very distinctly that none of the
signatories considered the Treaties of Locarno valid any longer. On
the contrary, the Western Powers proceeded to consider among
themselves the effects which their obligations of guaranteeing the
Western borders still had after Germany’s withdrawal. Regardless
of how one may judge Germany’s attitude of 1935, it remains to
be stated that the pact system had become untenable thereby. Hence
in 1940 German commitments to the Western Pact of 1925 no longer
existed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall on a later occasion discuss the existing arbitration treaties
and treaties by agreement with Belgium, Poland, and Czechoslovakia
in connection with the Locarno Treaty when discussing in general
Germany’s obligation for a peaceful settlement of disputes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As far as Luxembourg is concerned, not even the Prosecution
referred to the neutralization of this country. Evidently they went
<span class='pageno' title='583' id='Page_583'></span>
on the assumption that Germany had been forced by the Treaty of
Versailles to give up the rights given to her by the London Agreement
of 1867.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When, on 24 March 1941, the Yugoslav Government joined the
Tripartite Pact, Herr Von Ribbentrop could not, in the light of the
available news, assume that a few days later a military intervention
by Germany in the Balkans would be necessary for political reasons.
This situation was caused by the forcible change of government in
Belgrade. The reaction to the joining of the Tripartite Pact by the
Stojadinovič Government resulted in a new political change in Yugoslavia
under the leadership of Simovic, which aimed at close co-operation
with the Western Powers, counter to the idea of the
Tripartite Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of this uncertain situation in the interior of Yugoslavia,
which on account of the mobilization of the Yugoslav Army and
their deployment on the German frontier became a danger for the
Reich, Hitler suddenly decided on military operations in the Balkans.
He made this decision without the knowledge of Herr Von Ribbentrop,
with the idea of eliminating an imminent grave danger for his
Italian ally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The testimony of the witness Generaloberst Jodl has shown
beyond a doubt that Herr Von Ribbentrop, after Hitler’s decision
and after the Simovic Putsch, earnestly endeavored to be allowed
to exhaust all diplomatic possibilities prior to the beginning of military
operations. Generaloberst Jodl has confirmed here that Herr
Von Ribbentrop’s endeavors were rejected in so rude a manner that,
taking into consideration Hitler’s nature and the prevailing methods,
any influence on him was practically out of the question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the fact that ever since 4 March 1941 strong British
forces were pushing to the north from Southern Greece, a further
localization of the Italian-Greek conflict was no longer possible.
Although this war had begun in the autumn of 1940 against German
wishes, Hitler, with a view to the general situation, certainly could
not tolerate the imminent defeat of his Italian ally.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Herr Von Ribbentrop on 23 August 1939 signed at Moscow
the treaties between Germany and the Soviet Union, including the
secret agreement concerning the partition of Poland and the surrender
to Russia of the Baltic States, the sometimes very vehement
ideological discussions between National Socialism and Bolshevism
were for the time being eliminated from the international sphere
as an element of danger. This system of treaties, which was supplemented
in the course of the next month, had a favorable influence
on the opinion concerning Hitler’s foreign policy held by large
circles of the German people who were alarmed by the ideological
contrasts.
<span class='pageno' title='584' id='Page_584'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Ever since Bismarck signed the treaty of benevolent neutrality
with Russia there was a general conviction in Germany that the
maintenance of friendly relations with Russia must always be the
goal of our foreign policy. For the traditional reasons just mentioned,
Herr Von Ribbentrop at that time considered these pacts a
strong pillar of German foreign policy. Because of this opinion, in
the winter of 1940 he invited the Foreign Commissar of the Soviet
Union, Molotov, to visit Berlin to clear up problems which had
arisen in the meantime. Unfortunately this second conference did
not bring about the desired results.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler became very much alarmed at the results of this conference
and through secret information as to the future attitude of
the Soviet Union toward Germany. Especially the attitude of Russia
in the Baltic countries, as well as the Soviet march into Bessarabia
and into Bukovina, were considered by Hitler as actions which were
apt to endanger the German interests in the Baltic border states and
in the Romanian oil district. He saw, furthermore, in the attitude
of the Soviet Union the possibility of exercising influence on Bulgaria.
He found his suspicions confirmed by the conclusion of the
Friendship Pact with Yugoslavia on 5 April 1941, at a time when
Yugoslavia, after a change of government, threatened to join the
Western Powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of these misgivings of Hitler’s, of which he frequently
informed Herr Von Ribbentrop, the defendant tried to avoid tensions.
The Tribunal has permitted me to submit an affidavit which
confirms that Herr Von Ribbentrop, in December 1940 in detailed
discussion, still tried to induce Hitler once more to give him authority
to include Russia in the Tripartite Pact. This documentary
evidence confirms that Herr Von Ribbentrop, after his conference,
was justified in the opinion that he would succeed in this step with
the approval of Hitler. Subsequently, however, Hitler returned
again and again to his misgivings, which were strengthened by the
information of his own secret service about military operations on
the other side of the Eastern border. In the spring of 1941 Herr
Von Ribbentrop tried to bring to Hitler, at Berchtesgaden, the German
Ambassador in Moscow and one of his subordinates. Neither
of the diplomats was admitted. This ended the attempts possible
for Herr Von Ribbentrop within the scope of his position under the
regime. Afterwards he also believed that he could no longer shut
his eyes to the information which was brought to his knowledge.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As Generaloberst Jodl has testified, he and all the commanders
who took part in the beginning of the Russian campaign were convinced
that they had pushed right into the midst of an offensive
concentration of troops. This is proved, among other things, by
<span class='pageno' title='585' id='Page_585'></span>
maps which were found covering the territory beyond the German-Russian
line of interests. Is it really to be assumed that such conduct
by the Soviet Union is in agreement with the Non-Aggression
Pact?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Around that time the danger of a spreading of the European war
into a world war began to loom more and more threateningly. The
United States entered the arena of war under a neutrality law, by
which they subjected themselves in advance to clearly defined rules
in case of a future war. The mechanism of the neutrality law was
set in motion by a proclamation of the President. It designated at
the same time the danger zone within which American ships could
not count upon the protection of their government.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This attitude at the beginning of the war confirms that the
United States, the author of the Kellogg Pact, was not of the opinion
that the traditional law of neutrality had in any way been modified
by it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The United States, however, during the course of the spreading
and the aggravation of the European war, deviated more and more
from the original line, without the German Reich furnishing any
cause for conflict with them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>After the experiences of the first World War, German general
opinion, and consequently that of Herr Von Ribbentrop, was that
an intervention on the part of the United States should be prevented
by all means. Since the “quarantine” speech of President Roosevelt
in 1937 strong contrasts could, however, be noticed more and more
in the ideological-political train of thought of the world’s public
opinion. The situation was aggravated by the incidents of November
1938 in Germany, which were the reason for the recall of the
Berlin Ambassador to Washington to report, from whence he did
not return to his post.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If, in spite of that, the neutrality policy was further prepared by
legislative acts and became effective at the beginning of the war,
the German Foreign Office, and thus Herr Von Ribbentrop, could
conclude that the existing differences of opinion as to the internal
political development of the State would not change the neutral
attitude of the United States. Considering this expectation, not only
everything that could produce an unfavorable effect in the United
States was avoided from the outbreak of the war; but we also quietly
put up with quite a number of actions by the United States which
were weakening Germany and which were incompatible with strict
neutrality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The world public was informed of the agreement on the political
aims of neutral America and belligerent Great Britain when the
leading men of the two states proclaimed in August 1941 the Atlantic
Charter as the program for the new order of relations between
<span class='pageno' title='586' id='Page_586'></span>
the nations. It had a character obviously hostile to the Axis Powers
and left them in no doubt that the United States espoused the cause
of the other side.</p>

<p class='pindent'>There followed the incidents on the high seas which, as the evidence
has shown, can be credited to the account of the material
support of Great Britain by the United States.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By occupying Iceland and Greenland in the summer and autumn
of 1941 the U.S.A. took over the protection of the most important
line of communications of the then sorely struggling British Empire.
This amounted to military intervention even before the outbreak
of the officially declared war. The so-called “shooting order” of the
President brought about a dangerous situation which might have
resulted any day in the outbreak of armed conflict. Even several
months before 11 December 1941, the United States took measures
which were usually taken only during a war. The outbreak of the
war was only a link in the chain of successive incidents, perhaps
not even the most important. It was started by the Japanese attack
on Pearl Harbor, which, as the evidence has shown, was neither
instigated nor foreseen by Germany.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the formal definition of aggression, the declaration
of war is one of the criteria for the determination of the aggressor.
As I have already pointed out in connection with the spreading of
the war in Europe, this criterion alone without the factual background
is no positive proof for an act of aggression. As a reaction
to the numerous violations of neutrality by the United States, which
really represented actions of war, the German Reich would have
been justified long before in replying on her part with military
actions. Whether this right was exercised after the preceding announcement—that
is, a declaration of war—or not is immaterial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, I have thrown some light upon aggressive acts as
enumerated by the Prosecution from the beginning of the Polish
campaign to the entry into the war of the United States. It remains
for me to take up a juridical position regarding the treaties concluded
by Germany, which provided for a pacific settlement of political
conflicts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop is charged not only with having been a
party to aggressive acts, but also with failing in his duty to put
into play the mechanism of the aforesaid treaties previous to an
armed conflict. From the fact that the means for pacific settlement
as provided by the treaties had not been used, the Prosecution draws
the conclusion that these omissions can be attributed in a criminal
sense to Herr Von Ribbentrop. This interpretation however would
be erroneous from a legal aspect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If we begin by sharing the Prosecution’s point of view, we shall
see that even so the conclusions drawn by the Prosecution cannot
<span class='pageno' title='587' id='Page_587'></span>
be upheld. Assuming that an individual minister were criminally
responsible for the nonfunctioning of a series of treaties, even the
Prosecution would have to put the question whether the minister
was actually in a position to obtain through his actions a result of
any legal consequence. According to a principle embodied by nature
into every system of criminal law on earth, a defendant is punishable
for an omission only if he was actually in a position, and legally
liable, to act. I shall demonstrate at length, within the compass of
my arguments concerning the conspiracy, how small in fact Herr
Von Ribbentrop’s possibilities of influence were. The decisive point
at issue is the fact that he was not legally in a position to make any
declarations to foreign powers binding the German Reich other than
those he was empowered to by the head of the State. As head of
the State, Hitler was the representative of the German Reich from
the point of view of international law. He alone was in a position
to make binding declarations to foreign powers. Any other persons
could legally bind the German State only if authorized by the
head of the State, unless the treaty in question explicitly provided
otherwise.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is a characteristic not only of the German Führer State that
the Foreign Minister cannot independently enter into binding commitments
toward foreign powers. Rather it is a general principle
of international relations that only the organ empowered to represent
the state is able to act for it. The difference between
German conditions and those of democratic constitutions merely
lies in the fact that in the former the Foreign Minister usually
has a larger influence on the intentions of the head of the State.
The defendant, therefore, could not have obtained any legitimate
results if he had tried, against the Führer’s wish, to have recourse
to the possibilities of a settlement of conflict as provided by the
numerous treaties of arbitration and conciliation. No one but Hitler
could have put in motion such a procedure. The defendant could
have been in a position to do so by Hitler’s order only. He had
not even the right to have his advice listened to if Hitler chose
to ignore it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These points of view apply for example to the following treaties
enumerated by the Prosecution: The Convention for Peaceful Settlement
of International Disputes of 1899 and 1907 and the Treaty
of Arbitration of 1929 between Germany and Luxembourg. It
should be mentioned, moreover, that these agreements by no means
provided an obligatory settlement of political disputes.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As to treaties of arbitration and conciliation with Poland,
Czechoslovakia, and Belgium, concluded in connection with the
Locarno Treaty, the further point applies, quite apart from the
legal argument just mentioned, that they and the Western pact
<span class='pageno' title='588' id='Page_588'></span>
form a political unit. Even externally, this is expressed in the fact
that these agreements and the Locarno Pact are all of them annexed
to the general final protocol of the powers participating
in the Locarno Conference. The question could, therefore, be asked
whether the conciliation treaties share the fate of the principal
treaty, that is, the Western Pact.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should particularly like to point out that the procedure laid
down in these treaties ended in case of nonsettlement with the
League of Nations Council, in which, at the time of the Western
pact, the four participating great powers had, or—this applies to
Germany—were to have, permanent seats. The withdrawal of Italy
and Germany from this political body deeply affected the political
basis upon which the settlement treaties were based. Moreover,
the grouping of the powers had shifted so much that a part of the
Locarno great powers, namely Great Britain and France, had in
the year 1939, through agreements with Poland, already taken
sides in advance in case of a possible conflict.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning the treaties of arbitration and conciliation with
Denmark and the Netherlands of 1926, may I be allowed to point
out that the proceedings provided therein could not be applied at
all, as there were no conflicts between Germany and aforesaid
countries; quite to the contrary, Germany took steps which were
aimed at the enemy belligerents she wished to anticipate in the
occupation of these countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution mentions, moreover, a number of assurances
given by Hitler to countries with which Germany subsequently
waged war. Since Herr Von Ribbentrop did not give such assurances
in person, but rather the Führer, his participation could form a
point of argument only if he had given advice to Hitler in this
respect. No evidence has been produced to sustain such a suggestion.
A large part of these so-called assurances is contained in
speeches made by Hitler before the German public, either in mass
meetings or at the Reichstag. It is doubtful indeed whether such
declarations, addressed in the first place to the German public,
could have any binding results in the field of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Whereas up to now I have spoken about the actions that led
to the outbreak of the war and its spread, I shall now proceed to
the second large complex of the Indictment, which deals with crimes
committed during the war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter, in Article 6(b), declares violations of the laws or
customs of war to be punishable. This conception is illustrated by
a number of examples such as deportation, shooting of hostages,
et cetera. But these examples fail to complete this conception in
full. We are therefore obliged, in the same way as with Article 6(a),
<span class='pageno' title='589' id='Page_589'></span>
to propose to the Court a qualification which it can use as a basis
for its decisions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My conception agrees with the procedure proposed by the French
Prosecution. They have declared that they should be free to qualify
definitions of punishable offenses not fully defined by the Charter.
What is good for the Prosecution is good for the Defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The use of the expression “laws and usages of war,” as well
as the enumeration of examples, forces one to believe that the
Charter aims at violations of the classical <span class='it'>jus in bello</span>. I therefore
qualify war crimes as offenses against binding law established
between belligerents by agreement, or against binding and generally
recognized prescriptive law. The individual facts which range under
the collective conception of War Crimes, therefore, must each be
examined as to whether they are to be regarded as such according
to the traditional rules applying to armed conflicts between states.
Whereas, in general, classical international law holds responsible
the state as a unit only, there always existed in the usage of war
the exception that also acting individuals were liable to be held
responsible. How far this responsibility of the individual can be
followed by criminal proceedings after the war has been the subject
of many discussions. It can be ascertained that the prevailing
practice of states is that the belligerent who has been injured by
a war crime may also, after the war, call the offender to account.
If several states, which have fought shoulder to shoulder in the
war, form a common court against the war criminals of the conquered
adversary, this court has the collective competency of all
the states that form the court or have joined its charter.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When speaking of the liability of individuals to be punished
for crimes committed during the war against the adversary, who
thereafter sits in judgment upon him, one thinks in the first place
of former members of the armed forces. Already at Versailles
there were difficulties in answering the question as to what extent
military chiefs were to be made responsible. The idea of having
a minister of a department held responsible under criminal law
has so far never emerged. In Versailles, too, the War Criminals
Committee was occupied with the question of making nonmilitary
personalities responsible from a purely political point of view.
This committee discriminated clearly between war criminals, which
were to be judged by the Allied court, and guilt with regard to
the outbreak of war, for the examination and judging of which
a special international political court was to be created.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The customary conception is therefore that a minister cannot
be held responsible for violations of the <span class='it'>jus in bello</span>. The Prosecution
can achieve this only by going the roundabout way via a
conspiracy. If we follow the interpretation given to this conception,
<span class='pageno' title='590' id='Page_590'></span>
the Foreign Minister of the Reich would, for example, be responsible
for the destruction of the village of Oradour. He would have
to take responsibility for actions which have nothing in the least
to do with the Reich’s foreign policy and are merely isolated actions
by some office or other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As the hearing of evidence has shown, the Reich Foreign Minister
was not only not competent for the conduct of war, but had in
fact not the slightest possibility of influencing military measures
as far as either curbing or furthering them was concerned.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one wished to regard the various cabinet ministers as a clique
of conspirators also with regard to War Crimes, it would have to
be proved that the military offices competent to conduct the war
acted in agreement with the ministers or at least after having
given them the necessary information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The concentration of military authorities and ministers into a
unity of purpose, directed toward the perpetration of such criminal
acts abominated by all decent people, is an artificial subsequent
construction of the Prosecution. The unity, which did not exist
at the time when it is supposed to have been effective, has only
now been drawn up as a conception. The facts are now subsequently
to fit the conception. It is obvious that criminal proceedings
cannot be built up on such a method.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop cannot therefore be punished without
discrimination for all war crimes committed during the war by
the German side. Such a responsibility for the results would be
absolutely grotesque. He could only be held responsible for individual
acts if he himself participated in certain concrete individual
actions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop is accused by the Prosecution, according
to the testimony of General Lahousen, of having issued “directives”
to Admiral Canaris to have Ukrainian villages set afire and to
massacre the Jews living there. First I wish to establish the fact
that even a Foreign Minister cannot issue directives of any sort
to a military agency. Furthermore, it would have been wholly
nonsensical to issue such directives for the setting afire of Ukrainian
villages. Ukrainians supported the German fight against the Poles.
Thus hardly anyone will believe that Herr Von Ribbentrop at
that time advised the destruction of his own allies. My client
further insists categorically that not one word was mentioned
about the massacre of Jews in that particular conference, the less
so, since there was no reason for it at all.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I beg the Tribunal to base their decision regarding charges of
War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity raised against Herr
Von Ribbentrop, on the general attitude of the accused with respect
<span class='pageno' title='591' id='Page_591'></span>
to questions of humanity. As was proved beyond doubt by the
evidence, Herr Von Ribbentrop saved the lives of 10,000 Allied
prisoners of war through vigorous personal intervention. As I will
further show, within the framework of the conspiracy he was
instrumental in the unfettering of British prisoners of war and
he used his influence for the observance of the rules of the Geneva
Convention. He was opposed to the branding of Russian prisoners
of war. These are instances upon which the Tribunal may base
their decision with respect to questions of humanity.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This may also be an appropriate gauge for the general behavior
of the accused as concerns questions of humanity in problems where
he was not actively involved.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Furthermore, his attitude in the question of the treatment of
terrorist airmen is charged as a war crime to Herr Von Ribbentrop.</p>

<p class='pindent'>My client, as well as the Defendant Göring, deny that the conference
at Schloss Klessheim mentioned in Document 735-PS ever
took place. I should like to emphasize that General Warlimont,
who made these notes, did not personally participate in the
conference. Furthermore, the opinion allegedly voiced by Herr
Von Ribbentrop, according to the document, stands in contradiction
to his usual demeanor in this question. State Secretary Steengracht
deposed here that Herr Von Ribbentrop, after the publication of
the notorious article about lynch law in <span class='it'>Das Reich</span>, at once
vigorously protested against it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Further evidence concerning the problem of terrorist airmen,
through examination of the witnesses Generaloberst Jodl and Field
Marshal Keitel, proves that not only the Foreign Office but Herr
Von Ribbentrop personally made every effort in principle to uphold
the Geneva Convention and that Herr Von Ribbentrop together
with other leading personalities took pains to assure the retention
of at least the basic human principles, even approaching Hitler at
times when he lost all control of himself. In spite of all that
happened, the fact that in consequence of these steps the Geneva
Convention was not renounced must be called a success. Especially
with regard to terrorist airmen it must not be overlooked that
terror attacks in the form of air bombardments undeniably constitute
a war crime if they are undertaken indiscriminately on
cities and not on military and armament objectives only. It must
be taken into account in the reaction throughout Germany toward
the conduct of the air warfare of the Western Powers that, according
to established and traditional conceptions in armed conflict
between nations, attacks on the civilian population are prohibited.
This thought is not only expressed in the Hague Convention concerning
land warfare but constitutes a binding stipulation of general
international law, binding for all and not applicable to the theater
<span class='pageno' title='592' id='Page_592'></span>
of operations on land only. Acknowledging this, the Hague Rules
of Air Warfare of 1923, although permitting air attacks on military
objectives in undefended cities, do not permit the bombing of the
dwellings of the civilian population. Although the Hague rules
were not ratified, they were in practice followed by all belligerents
and acknowledged as prescriptive law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These measures became especially acute after complete air
superiority had been achieved by the Allies and when the resulting
constant low-level attacks on the civilian population took place.
These particular events led for the first time to the discussion
whether, in the face of a warfare which was undeniably violating
international law, it was still of any use to uphold the Geneva Convention
in its substance. These considerations and corresponding
reflections led to the drafting of documents which have become
the object of evidence in the proceedings and which constituted, as
shown by the evidence, drafts but not decisions on this question.
They can therefore not form the basis of a judgment, since surely
a state is entitled to ask for the opinion of the competent authorities
on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the permission of the Tribunal I have presented the role
of Herr Von Ribbentrop before the war, at its outbreak, and
through its duration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Beyond this the Prosecution holds all defendants responsible for
every crime presented here. The idea of a conspiracy is being used
as a basis for this common liability. If the logical inferences were
to be drawn from this unlimited accusation, then each defense
counsel would have to deal with all the details presented by the
Prosecution. The obvious impossibility of taking up so much of the
Tribunal’s time shows how questionable the basis of the accusation
is. Therefore I have to confine myself to examining the participation
in the conspiracy only from the viewpoint of the actual and legal
position of the Foreign Minister in the Third Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Conspiracy in the sense of the Charter and of the Indictment
means a sort or form of participation in a punishable act. This kind
of offense was, until now, unknown to German and continental legal
conception. It exists only in Anglo-Saxon law. In this realm of law
by conspiracy is understood participation in a punishable act which
requires, at the very least, a common intent to commit a crime. A
further prerequisite is that the mutual plan leads to the perpetration
of a definite punishable offense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Charter proceeds from this form of participation in a crime
in declaring punishable all offenses stated in Paragraph 6, assuming
the existence of a conspiracy or a common plan, as a special form
of participation in these crimes. The Charter then stipulates, in
<span class='pageno' title='593' id='Page_593'></span>
Paragraph 6 (a), another special form of conspiracy declaring punishable
the participation in a Common Plan or Conspiracy to carry out
offensive wars or wars violating international treaties.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By the conception “common plan” the Charter and the Indictment
obviously understand something that reaches beyond the
sphere of conspiracy. Mr. Justice Jackson himself admitted that it
went beyond the punishable facts of a conspiracy according to
Anglo-Saxon law and thereby created a conception which is not yet
juridically formulated. Both forms of conspiracy constitute a liability
for all acts committed by any one person carrying out both these
forms of conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Indictment uses piracy as an example in order to make the
participants in this alleged conspiracy appear as a single body. The
conspirators are all on board of a pirate ship which, contrary to the
laws and justice of all nations, engages in robbery and therefore is
outlawed. Anyone who punishes the crew helps to restore justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At first glance this picture appears somewhat <span class='it'>à propos</span>. However,
on closer inspection, it becomes obvious that it is only a matter
of a catchword which tries to compare the community of the ship’s
crew, united with the ship for better or worse, to the dissimilar,
complicated conditions of a modern state organization. The ships of
all nations are, according to established, commonly recognized, and
uncontested conception, authorized to combat piracy on the high
seas upon encountering a pirate. The criminal law of almost all
nations knows explicit regulations for combating piracy. The peculiarity
of this offense in distinction from other acts punishable in
every country, whether committed against native, or foreign citizens—for
example white slave traffic acts, counterfeiting of coins,
and so forth—lies in the fact that jurisdiction is carried out on the
high seas. Therefore, the mistaken idea may arise that a crime in
the sphere of international law is concerned. This, however, is not
the case. Piracy is a common offense, the prosecution of which is,
by international law, permitted not only in coastal waters but also
on the high seas belonging to all nations. The basis for this conception
was laid in the United States in the beginning of the last
century by decisions given by Chief Justice Marshall.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The acts with which Herr Von Ribbentrop is charged were committed
at a time during which the German Reich and its opponents
confronted one another first in peace and then in war on the stage
of international relations. An example taken from the sphere of
common criminal law as practiced inside a country is not suitable
to convey a plastic representation of a conspiracy of an entire state
apparatus. In the first place, the idea of the state, which according
to the conception of traditional international law is the only bearer
of rights and duties, is systematically destroyed so that the persons
<span class='pageno' title='594' id='Page_594'></span>
standing behind it and acting on its behalf may separately be made
liable to criminal prosecution. Since as a rule only a few persons
acted directly as participants in the acts charged, the multitude of
these people is then again compressed into an artificial whole, in
order to hold them responsible also for those acts which were not
committed by them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the criticism of the jurist must start. According to our perception
of law and that of all civilized nations, criminal responsibility
is bound to basic rules showing but few divergences. Thus,
according to continental law, only such persons can be held responsible
for a punishable act who deliberately or through negligence
contribute to a definite act. According to unanimous agreement the
perpetrator, therefore, must know the plan to which he allegedly
contributed, foresee the acts committed in executing it, and approve
of them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Participation in the form of conspiracy was until now known as
an offense only to a limited legal circle. Therefore it is familiar
only to that part of the legal systems which are represented by the
nations who are conducting or have joined in the present proceedings.
It was completely unknown to the German conception of law
and, therefore, to Herr Von Ribbentrop at the time of his political
activity. This form of complicity marks a much wider range of
actions as criminal than Herr Von Ribbentrop could have anticipated
at the time of his activities in the field of foreign policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But even if this form of complicity is assumed as a basis for legal
findings according to the Charter, neither the official position as
Reich Foreign Minister held by Herr Von Ribbentrop nor the individual
acts committed by him in this capacity can make him appear
as a member of a conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The case of Von Ribbentrop shows in particular how, through
the introduction of the concept of a conspiracy, responsibilities
become interlocked which, taking into account the official position
and authority as well as the personal attitude of the individual conspirators,
have nothing whatever to do with each other.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution, however, in order to achieve its aim, compresses
into a subsequently fabricated unity a number of actions and individuals,
chosen at random, which have nothing at all to do with
one another. If one followed the Charter and the Indictment, the
result—wholly alien to any actual and legal thought—would be that
Herr Von Ribbentrop, while personally and actually completely
eliminated from any influence over the Occupied Eastern Territories,
as thoroughly proved by the evidence, would have to bear
the responsibility for all War Crimes and Crimes against Humanity
committed there, whereas, for instance, the Defendant Streicher,
<span class='pageno' title='595' id='Page_595'></span>
although he headed his own special department, would be answerable
for the foreign policy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one confirms the existence of a conspiracy to commit War
Crimes and Crimes against Humanity it would practically result in
making, for example, Herr Von Ribbentrop and the Foreign Office
responsible for such crimes, whereas evidence has shown that this
very office always tried to observe the rules of warfare according
to international law and to adhere to the Geneva Convention even
when this involved a severe struggle with Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The conspiracy to commit War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity can refer only to actual offenses against rules of war,
either individual actions, as, for example, the execution of escaped
British Air Force officers or certain measures incompatible with the
accepted rules of war. In any case, the unity of conspirators must
relate to a specific act or to specific groups of acts of the same
nature. It is impossible to hold a defendant responsible for actions
not approved by him or which he has tried to prevent.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I think the Prosecution will agree that there simply cannot exist any conspiracy
to commit crimes against the usages and customs of war. This concept
is so controversial and is so undetermined in the practice of the states and in the
theory of international law that individual acts, which in the course of a war may
be considered as war crimes, could not form a part of the plans of the conspirators.
It must also be considered that the development of means and
methods of war modified also the contents of the concept of war crimes. Therefore
there can be only a conspiracy to commit specific or similar war crimes.
Not every one of the so-called conspirators can be held responsible for each
and every action which an objective judgment must define afterwards as a
war crime. Particularly, it would not meet the purpose of chastising the guilty
if the defendants were to be punished according to the general and artificial
concept of conspiracy even for such war crimes which they tried to prevent
with all their efforts.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>PRESIDENT: The Tribunal will recess now.</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'>DR. HORN: With permission of the Tribunal, I shall continue on
Page 79 of my final plea.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point of view just mentioned applies particularly to Herr
Von Ribbentrop. Not only did the military conduct of war have
nothing to do with his department; but he was, as was proved by
evidence, expressly excluded from it by repeated orders of Hitler.
His department was only affected by War Crimes insofar as they
led to negotiations with foreign powers. Moreover the fact, for
instance, that after the terrible air raid on Dresden the execution
of over 10,000 Allied prisoners of war was prevented through Herr
Von Ribbentrop’s intervention with Hitler proves that, when informed
of imminent War Crimes, he did what was in his power to
do within his sphere of influence. These arguments and the result
<span class='pageno' title='596' id='Page_596'></span>
of evidence show how unjust it would be to share the point of view
held by the Prosecution, that is, to hold a Foreign Minister with
limited authority responsible for War Crimes and Crimes against
Humanity, the more so as it has been conclusively proved that he
was excluded from any influence on the conduct of war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With the Court’s permission I shall now deal with the alleged
conspiracy for the planning and preparation of aggressive wars and
the violation of treaties. Within the framework of such a conspiracy,
the defendant is apparently to be held responsible in his capacity
as Minister for Foreign Affairs and the offices formerly held by him
in the diplomatic service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This kind of conspiracy apparently deals with any act or plan
which has any connection with war, its preparation, outbreak, and
course. As the individual acts within this enormous range are irrelevant
themselves as regards criminality and until now have never
been conceived from the point of view of criminality under “outbreak
of war,” this kind of conspiracy does not contain any facts
so far known by any system of criminal law in the world. Therefore
I can investigate this complex only from the point of view of
Von Ribbentrop’s ministerial position and his relation to the German
Reich which waged the various wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop, from 4 February 1938, held the position
of a Minister of Foreign Affairs of the German Reich. As shown by
the evidence, Herr Von Ribbentrop was called to his office on 4 February
1938 at a time when the actual leadership of foreign policy
had already passed to Hitler in his double capacity of Reich Chancellor
and head of the State. I have submitted as a document Hitler’s
speech of 19 July 1940 delivered at the Kroll Opera House in which
he emphasized that Herr Von Ribbentrop had had to handle foreign
policy for years according to Hitler’s political directives. Herr
Von Ribbentrop, therefore, did not hold the position of a minister
as understood by modern political constitutions. As shown in the
above-mentioned speech, he did not hold it either in fact or in law.
This is shown by an examination of the public law of the Third
Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to constitutional law, as it has developed in modern
states in the course of the nineteenth and in the beginning of the
twentieth century, the department of the Minister of Foreign Affairs
belongs to the executive departments. The Minister for Foreign
Affairs has to share with the Prime Minister the responsibility of
conducting foreign policy. In a parliamentary democracy this involves
responsibility towards the representatives of the people; in
a monarchical or presidential constitution responsibility toward the
head of the state. Such responsibility is actually of political importance
only and results in the resignation of a minister from his
<span class='pageno' title='597' id='Page_597'></span>
office when he no longer enjoys the confidence of parliament or of
the head of the state. Most constitutions make provisions for the
indictment of a minister by the representatives of the people in case
of violation of official duties. But even when convicted by a constitutional
court, through some kind of criminal procedure, the minister
is not punished; but his conduct is merely declared to have
been wrong.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Both possibilities to call ministers to account were provided by
the German constitution of the Weimar Republic. The indicting of
a minister was however never put into practice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The state law of the Third Reich brought a complete change in
these matters. A short time after Hitler had come to power parliament
was asked, with reference to existing internal difficulties, to
give its consent to an Enabling Act. The German people and its
representatives expected at the time that this authorization was to
be used temporarily and merely for the removal of actual distress.
This law became, however, the foundation of a complete readjustment
of the constitution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The possibility of parliamentary responsibility no longer existed.
It changed into responsibility towards the Führer and Reich Chancellor,
in whose person the authority relinquished by parliament
now rested. Now there remained but one responsibility: that toward
the head of the State. Starting from this parliamentary authorization,
all functions deriving from the authority of the State were
concentrated more and more in Hitler personally. The traditional
division of power, the result of a struggle for constitutional rights
lasting more than a century, became, by the fusion of all means of
power, an empty shell and thereby obsolete. Full powers were
concentrated in the hands of the Führer, who made use of them
separately through his plenipotentiaries. The constitutional jurisprudence
of the Third Reich designated this as change from the
actual to the functional division of power.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The individual minister, after this change had taken place, did
not act any longer on his own responsibility but only on the order
he had received from the head of the State. What applied to the
individual also applied to the former Reich Cabinet. It had no
longer any influence on state leadership but constituted merely a
collective term for various branches of the administration which
were technically separated. As the political tasks no longer existed
with which normally the ministers as a group—that is, the Cabinet—had
to deal, the tasks of the council of ministers were automatically
settled by the very weight of the facts themselves. Therefore, as the
hearing of witnesses has shown, it never met during Von Ribbentrop’s
period of office.
<span class='pageno' title='598' id='Page_598'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Even the designation “minister” did not signify any longer the
head of a government department but became a mere title expressing
a rank.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The result of this reform was that the Minister for Foreign
Affairs also no longer had the right to determine the outline of foreign
policy. Evidence has shown this fact also in the form of
speeches and utterances of Hitler, in which, for instance after the
occupation of the Rhineland and the Anschluss of Austria, he said
that he had brought about these—as he called them—“great decisions”
against the will of his advisers on his own resolve, referring
to his responsibility toward the German people and to history. Seen
from the point of view of constitutional law, this means that no
minister had any possibility of preventing the decisions. Neither
had he constitutionally any authority to examine the legality of the
Führer’s decisions. For the above-mentioned concentration of all
functions of state power in Hitler’s person, shows that he had both
legislative and executive authority. Any pattern for the acts of
legislation was no longer provided for in the Third Reich. Also there
was no measure by which one could gauge from the tenor of the
Führer’s decision whether he acted in his capacity as legislator or
as head of the executive authority. The conception of material law,
which in Germany as in all continental states was well established
up to the assumption of power, completely lost its meaning. Even
individual directives were given in the form of laws.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In all constitutions the authorities whose task it is to apply laws
are not allowed to examine their purport. This applies even to
jurisdiction, and all the more so to the administrative authorities.
The application of a law that was made in the regular way provided
for by the constitution may not be refused by any office of the state.
Examination even by courts of law is limited to the question of
determining whether the way laid down by the constitution has been
followed. This is also the case in Great Britain and the United
States, where decrees issued by the executive authorities, but not
laws passed by Parliament, may be subject to examination with
regard to their content.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the constitution of the Third Reich there was only one authority
for all expressions of the will of the State—the Führer. Often
it could not be perceived in what capacity he acted, owing to the
destruction of the concept of constitutional law. The doctrine of
constitutional law of the Third Reich therefore was debased to a
theology of revelations of the Führer. The former discriminations
no longer existed for the ministers. The only question that could
arise in the constitutional law of the Third Reich was whether the
will of the Führer was expressed in such a concrete way as to
reflect the will of the State.
<span class='pageno' title='599' id='Page_599'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This constitutional practice was unmistakably the result of
having transferred the pseudo-military way of thinking to the
sphere of politics. The conceptions of obedience and discipline were
transferred to a sphere in which they were out of place.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with the elimination of the traditional division of
power, one fact must be pointed out which is just as characteristic
for this <span class='it'>despotia sui generis</span>, as it speaks against the existence of a
Conspiracy or a Common Plan. The evidence given shows no kind
of advisory council or any organ of control over the head of the
State. Neither the Cabinet nor the Reich Defense Council nor any
other advisory committee had any influence on Hitler’s decisions.
The key documents and the statements of witnesses show only
monologues by Hitler before an ever-increasing audience. Everything
that has the appearance of a council is in reality a reunion
for the receipt of orders. The evidence presented has definitely
shown that efforts to influence Hitler at best led to unexpected
reactions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herr Von Ribbentrop and several of the other defendants without
doubt had considerable power in their own spheres, which did
not interest Hitler. They were, however, completely denied participation
in the great decisions on war or peace, armistice, peace
offers, <span class='it'>et cetera</span>.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the position of Foreign Minister, as held by Herr Von Ribbentrop,
an independent personality was not tolerated. Herr Von Ribbentrop
was aware of this, as State Secretary Steengracht has testified
here. He stated that Hitler at the most had use for a secretary for
foreign affairs but not for a Foreign Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This development in the practice of constitution and government
can hardly be reconciled with the thought of a Common Plan or
Conspiracy. The conspiracy demands, as we have seen, a unanimity
or correspondence in aims in which the participants form their will
freely. The political practice of the Third Reich knew only acclamation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So far, my examinations have been based on the norms of
actual criminal law as laid down in Article 6. I should not like
to close my statement without drawing the Court’s attention to
the relation between politics and law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The essence of politics is and remains, in the life of sovereign
states, the defense of the interests of one’s own people. In order
not to let this interpretation of politics degenerate into unscrupulousness,
international life has established the principles of the
settlement of interests and diplomacy as representative of this
principle. It is diplomacy which has had an essential influence in
establishing the principles of international relations and, therefore,
of international law. The imperfection of international law is
<span class='pageno' title='600' id='Page_600'></span>
caused by the coexistence of many countries confronting one
another on a level of equal rights. Its weak spot was the lack of
any superior authority which would have been in a position to
insure the existence of legal order in the same way as the authority
of a state is able to within its own borders. Therefore at all times
the unrestrained display of force has been allowed a wider range
in the international sphere. Statesmen are in duty bound to take
care of their own people’s interests. If their politics are a failure,
the countries they act for have to bear the consequences. They
themselves are judged by the judgment of history. But in a legal
sense they were responsible only to their own state for acts with
which their state was charged by others as infringing international
law. The foreign country injured by the action in question could
not indict the acting individual. The barrier erected by international
law, respectful of national sovereignty, between the acting
individual and foreign powers was only removed in the case of
war crimes whereof I have spoken. At any rate, at the beginning
of the second World War this conception was, despite all attempts
to the contrary, the unshaken concept of international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French chief prosecutor gave, as a reason for the indictment
of leading men of the late regime, the fact that a German
Government, which might have been able to take legal proceedings
in these cases, no longer existed. With the greatest esteem for
this polished argument, it cannot remain hidden to a critical observer
that such sharp logic is subject to false conclusions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Any organized resistance headed by a national government came
to an end when the German Armed Forces were utterly defeated
and the whole of the German territory occupied by the Allies.
The four principal victorious powers, which form this Tribunal,
acquired by their might a legal right recognized by international
law to decide the fate of the German national territory. They
could have divided Germany up. But they chose another way. In
the Berlin Declaration of 5 June 1945, they assumed “supreme
authority within Germany, including all the powers possessed by
the German Government, the High Command of the Armed Forces,
and any state, municipal, or local government or authority.” But
this was all. The declaration expressly emphasized that the transfer
of the authority did not mean the annexation of Germany. The
exercise of the claimed rights was transferred to the Control Commission,
composed of the commanders-in-chief of the four occupation
zones.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since the Berlin Declaration, Germany has been in a provisional
state which is still prevailing. At the Potsdam Conference held in
July 1945 the four powers among themselves made further agreements,
of which we were informed by the communiqué of 2 August
<span class='pageno' title='601' id='Page_601'></span>
1945. The Potsdam Agreement for the establishing of a Council of
Foreign Ministers transfers to the said Council the preparation of a
peace settlement, which is to be accepted by a German government
“when a government suitable for this purpose has been organized.”
A second agreement provides regulations concerning Germany while
under Allied control.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This wording makes it clear that Germany is to remain a national
state, that it is being placed under Allied control, and that the
establishment of a German government is intended. This government
is thereupon to accept peace conditions. This involves a
government which is in a position to enter into commitments toward
foreign powers as a partner qualified in international law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The victors have accordingly chosen to exercise the right of
decision given to them by conquest in such a way that the German
State will not be destroyed. During the transition period they
themselves exercise the functions of the temporarily non-existing
German Government. We are, therefore, entitled to take the Potsdam
Declaration as a conjecture for the legal review of Germany’s
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The German State, accordingly, has not been annihilated. It
would therefore be wrong, juridically speaking, and we would incur
the reproach of lack of historical understanding, if we considered
as new that state the direction of which is envisaged under its own
government. Germany is burdened with obligations which arose
from her past. This is possible only if the state, upon whose behavior
the obligation was based and who one day must answer
for it, is regarded as the same legal body. Though the German
State, at the moment, is not in position to act according to international
law through its own organs, it has not vanished from the
sphere of the international legal order.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Thus, in view of the fact that M. de Menthon’s premise is untenable,
his final deductions cannot be accepted. Therefore the
jurisdiction of the victorious powers over German subjects with
regard to their acts connected with politics cannot be based on
current international law. Thus the Charter abandons the international
legal code. Furthermore, it contradicts fundamental principles
of criminal law. If the French prosecutor is of the opinion
that the Tribunal exercises the penal authority of the German State,
a state which according to his opinion does not exist at this time,
then he must logically apply the sentence <span class='it'>nullum crimen sine lege</span>
to the criminal law existing in Germany. An act could therefore
be punishable only if at the time of its commission it was punishable
according to the German law. This does not apply either to personal
criminal responsibility for the violation of international
<span class='pageno' title='602' id='Page_602'></span>
treaties and assurances or to the participation in the Conspiracy or
Common Plan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In recognition of this, the Control Council for Germany in its
Proclamation Number 3 has reinstituted in the system of German
criminal law two constitutional principles from which the Hitler
regime had deviated, namely, prohibition of retroaction and analogy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The political criminal concepts of the Charter set a standard of
new legal principles which must be considered as the embryo of a
code of world law. Herr Von Ribbentrop, at the time when the
incriminating events took place, lacked the apperception that there
might be such a code of world law.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can dispense with the necessity for ruling in advance that
an act is criminal only in the very few cases where the cruelty of
the act is so evident that there can be no doubt as to its deserving
punishment. This could hold good for acts which were not punished
in Germany during the last years solely in consequence of certain
measures of the abnormal amorality of the Hitler regime.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have heretofore presented the evidence from the point of view
of valid international law and the Charter which you, Mr. President,
in the session of 20 June 1946, again stressed as the basis for legal
findings in these proceedings. Up to now, the code of international
law has been unable to solve the problems which are to be decided
here. On the basis of this inadequacy the second World War
broke out.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The effects of this catastrophe, which this legal code could not
prevent, cannot yet be perceived today. To prevent its recurrence
in the future is the high aim of humanity, which forms the basis
of the London Agreement of 8 August 1945. That this could not
yet be achieved is shown with alarming certainty by the fact that,
on the very day on which the Charter of this Court was proclaimed
to the world as a new law, the war between the Soviet Union and
Japan broke out. Its realization had been promised to the Allies by
the Soviet Union 6 months prior to that. To justify it, it was
pointed out, among other things, that Russia had to settle an old
account with Japan. In other words, this typifies a case of an
unprovoked attack.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have illustrated that the attack and the attacker cannot be dealt
with by a general definition covering every act of reality. The
attacker can only be branded by a world authority. This supreme
organ of mankind must possess not only an actual but also a moral
authority. Universal trust must be put in its impartial judgment.
It must be a tribunal standing high above the conflicting parties;
before which these parties appear only as seekers of justice but may
have no place in it as judges.
<span class='pageno' title='603' id='Page_603'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We live in a period of transition, from an old law under whose
rule the ruins around us were created, to a new code of world law,
which while taking shape, is not yet morally and effectively consolidated.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To judge and punish the acts which were committed by the
former Foreign Minister, Herr Von Ribbentrop, his share in the
happenings, the extent of his inadequacies, and his own personal
guilt, is a difficult task almost beyond human strength in this
period of decadence and revival.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: We will call on Dr. Nelte, counsel for the
Defendant Keitel.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>DR. NELTE: “We must approach our task with so much inner
deliberation and mental integrity that this Trial will later
appear to posterity as the fulfillment of human longing for
justice.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>These words of Justice Jackson in his opening speech for the
Prosecution must be the guiding principle for all those who have
been entrusted with the noble task of contributing to the search
for truth in this Trial. That this truth cannot be absolute has
already been stated by the Prosecutors Justice Jackson and M. Dubost.
The purpose of the Indictment is not to determine the historical
aspect, let alone the historical development of this short but so
tragically important period, but instead to find out whether, and to
what extent, the defendants sitting on this bench participated in the
events which have affected the entire world by their consequences
and which have brought such indescribable misery upon it, and not
least upon the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this Trial the Prosecution once stated through one of their
qualified spokesmen that it was their task to submit material that
would incriminate the defendants and submit only such incriminating
evidence. Thus, in contrast to the principle of objective accusation
which dominates the German criminal proceedings, they made
clear their definitely one-sided standpoint in an Indictment which
obliges the Defense to...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: [<span class='it'>Interposing.</span>] I have already corrected this
misstatement which you have made in your speech here, in dealing
with one of the other speeches for the Defense. It is not the practice
of the Prosecution to conceal any evidence which tends in favor of
the accused.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I am afraid I cannot hear.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: What I said was that I had already corrected
the erroneous view, which is expressed in this paragraph in your
speech, that it is the practice of the Prosecution to conceal anything
they know which, may tend in favor of the accused.
<span class='pageno' title='604' id='Page_604'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, on this very spot Mr. Justice Jackson
stated, “We cannot serve two masters,” when he replied to the statement
that according to German criminal law the Prosecution would
also have to produce material in favor of the defendants. What I am
stating here is not said in order to raise any type of accusation
against the Prosecution. On the contrary, from the point of view
for which they stood they have done everything that was possible.
I merely wanted to clarify my point of view as defendant’s counsel
and say why...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: The only reason I interrupted you was because
of the sentence in your speech, “They made clear their definitely
one-sided standpoint.” In the second paragraph, the second
sentence of that paragraph, you say,</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Thus, in contrast to the principle of objective accusation
which dominates the German criminal proceedings, they made
clear”—that is, the Prosecution made clear—“their definitely
one-sided standpoint in an Indictment...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I said “one-sided”—that contrary to the governing
principle of German criminal procedure, which is objective indictment,
it has made clear its definitely one-sided standpoint of indictment
which obliges the Defense to submit all circumstances and
considerations which are indispensable for an objective administration
of justice.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on. It may be a different translation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: For this purpose, it is first necessary to clarify certain
concepts which are needed for the perception of responsibility
and guilt. As far as concepts of international and constitutional law
are concerned, they have been examined and presented by Professor
Dr. Jahrreiss.</p>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the sphere of the soldier I should like to make
some fundamental statements. There have been repeated references
here to the concepts of soldierly conduct, obedience, loyalty, performance
of duty, and patriotism. It is my belief that all men
recognize these concepts to be good. But it is permissible to say
that not all of these concepts are unequivocal. Thus are opposed:
“best soldierly conduct” and “militarism,” “natural obedience” and
“contemptible blind subservience,” “the categorical imperative of
the performance of duty” and “the exaggerated sense of responsibility,”
“the deep love for one’s country” and “chauvinism.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>We see that all these concepts can run through the scale of good
and evil. The origin and the essence of these concepts are everywhere
the same, but the forms they take on through tradition and
education and by the effects thereof vary greatly. However, if this
is the case, who then should differentiate and decide whether the
<span class='pageno' title='605' id='Page_605'></span>
feeling is still in the realm of good or has already reached the
sphere of evil?</p>

<p class='pindent'>We are all of us living in a world whose century-old striving
has aimed at the creation of order. Order is certainly a relative
concept, too, but it is everywhere the establishment of the relationship
of human beings to each other which guarantees the best possible
means of living peacefully side by side in view of the intrinsic
character of each country.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This holds true both for the state and for the relationship between
nations. Who should determine in this order what is right
and what is wrong? The criterion for this might be, according to
the traditional conception, only a constitutional, that is, a national
one. The drawing closer of the nations by world traffic and general
civilization resulted in the various national concepts becoming
adjusted to each other in spite of many differences. It must be
admitted that this process of adjustment suffered a harmful set-back
through certain National Socialist doctrines and their methods.
Nevertheless, the principle remains inviolable that the criterion of
right or wrong must be a national one, if order is not to be dissolved.
The only thing worth striving for is the adjustment of
nations and national fundamental concepts to each other as is now
being attempted through world organization.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Although the national criterion, that is, the national judgment
of good and bad, right and wrong, had been well established in any
case up to now, the concepts never have been deprived of their
relativity, especially when national differences existed for other
reasons. A convincing example of this is the opinion expressed
about the resistance movement.</p>

<p class='pindent'>All countries extol what is considered to be the highest form of
patriotism: When someone risks his life for his country under the
utmost danger. However, according to the Hague Rules of Land
Warfare such resistance movement is forbidden. We have here a
clear example of the contrast between ethical and legal evaluation.
This proves that there are no absolute concepts of good and bad or
right and wrong and that beyond all written laws there are unwritten
laws which acquit the culprit when he obeys those higher
laws. Those higher laws, however, also depend on subjective and
national, that is, collectively subjective considerations. If anybody
believes something to be good or right, such faith may come into
existence out of an actually higher law, a truly higher idea; but it
may also grow out of misled faith, out of a false idea. Who would
or who could judge whether a faith or an idea was or was not right?
History teaches that usually the successful idea is recognized as
right, to a certain extent because it is a divine judgment. I do not
<span class='pageno' title='606' id='Page_606'></span>
wish to decide whether that is always true. The question here, however,
is whether the people whose guilt is to be judged acted in good
faith, in accordance with such an idea and such a faith. If the ordeal
has demonstrated this faith to be wrong, the question remains open
whether the people could believe the idea to be good for comprehensible
or explainable reasons.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This question constitutes the problem which concerns not only
Defendant Keitel but also the entire German nation. According to
the speech of the French Prosecution not only the defendants in this
Trial are the really guilty ones, but the entire German nation. The
extent and importance of this thesis are tremendous. Should the
Tribunal—if only on the grounds for its decision—come to the conclusion
that the entire German nation is guilty, every German for
incalculable time will bear the brand of Cain which finally must
lead to the destruction of this people and its dissolution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It has been stated most authoritatively that there is no intention
here of accusing the entire German people. Through unconditional
surrender we are left entirely to the mercy of the victorious powers
for better or worse. It was said, however, that the verdict of this
Tribunal is to be just. Here in this Court it is not clemency or
inclemency which are to be the guiding principle but justice. Justice
does not mean mildness. A verdict, however, will only be just
if it takes into consideration all the circumstances which underlie
the actions and conduct of the defendants. There is no excuse for
what has happened and for what forms the subject of this Indictment.
I can only try to give an analysis.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The misery, the misfortune that has fallen on the entire human
race is so great that words do not suffice to express it. The German
people, especially after having learned the catastrophe that has
befallen the nations in the West and East and the Jews, is shaken
by horror and pity for the victims. The German nation knows what
this misfortune means; for it is stricken as hardly any other nation
is, not only in the military field but through the sinister consequences
of air attacks, through the loss of millions of its youth in
the field, through evacuations and escapes in ice and snow. We
know, therefore, what it means to be in misery and to have to suffer.
But while other nations are able to look upon all this misery and
all this misfortune as a chapter of the past, and in the protection of
constitutional order have the comforting hope of returning to an
orderly existence and a happy future, there still rests upon this
nation the gloom of despair. By affirming the guilt of the entire
nation the verdict of this Tribunal would perpetuate this despair.
The German people does not expect to be acquitted. It does not
expect the cloak of Christian charity and oblivion to be spread over
all that has happened. The German nation is ready to the last to
<span class='pageno' title='607' id='Page_607'></span>
take the consequences upon itself. It is willing to accept it as its
fate and do everything to participate in removing the consequences.
It hopes, however, that the soul and hearts of the rest of mankind
will not be so hardened that the existing tension, in fact the existing
hatred, between this nation and the rest of mankind will remain.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Your task, Your Honors, is a terribly hard one. We not only
speak different languages, each of us feels with the soul of his own
country. Much of what has happened in this country will seem
incomprehensible to you. The feelings of the German people in its
different categories are not your feelings. One of the most essential
points, especially in the case of the soldier, seems to me the way of
judging what freedom is felt to be. In this country, too, the ideal
of freedom was proclaimed. All of us know that the most extreme
form of freedom is anarchy. No state desires anarchy, because it
means surrender of its own existence. If therefore, all countries
agree that the absolute concept of freedom is never worth striving
for and can never be sanctioned, there results, perforce, relativity
of the concept of freedom. No concept has been so misused as the
concept of freedom, and yet every political system proclaims freedom
as the greatest of all blessings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>By that, I by no means wish to say that the concept of freedom
as proclaimed by National Socialism was the right solution. What
I do wish to say, however, is that National Socialism also knew the
concept of freedom and made it clear to the people through propaganda
that its conception of freedom was the right one. National
Socialism was aided in this by the fact that under the effects of the
Treaty of Versailles Germany could indeed make no claim to be
really free. The limitations of its sovereignty were so pronounced
and so evident that it was easy for National Socialism to proclaim
the fight for the freedom of the fatherland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As long as the fatherland is recognized in the world as the
highest worldly possession, endeavors to keep this possession must
be understood and will not be disapproved of even when it is an
adversary who makes them. One may be of a different opinion as
to the method which should be used for the realization of these
endeavors and as to how freedom is to be attained. This, however,
is not decided by the individual but by that person or those persons
who hold the power in a state.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Every human being wants something to hold on to in life; he
must have it if he is not to sink into anarchy. Public order at the
side of moral order is a firm support and the foundation of his
existence, and this gives him a feeling of security in his life and
professional activities. It is the deep longing of all civilized men
for order which finds its highest fulfillment in the institutions of the
state. On the other hand, the citizen must have confidence that the
<span class='pageno' title='608' id='Page_608'></span>
state, that is, its official agencies, will safeguard law and order. In
this respect it should not matter which party provides the guardians
of its inviolable principles. That is just where the confidence of a
nation as a whole expresses itself, namely, by leaving leadership
to the prevailing majority. National Socialism undoubtedly aimed
at and succeeded in rousing the belief in wide circles of the German
people that its endeavors were supported by the majority of the
people. It thereby procured for itself the alibi of legality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Far from all political considerations, as all the generals and
admirals have testified here, the leaders of the Armed Forces
believed in the legitimacy of Hitler’s Government. It looked upon
itself as the instrument of a legal government, as it did when the
Kaiser, Ebert, and Von Hindenburg were Germany’s representatives.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Like all tendencies, all forms of expression of feeling, the feeling
of patriotism and of a soldierly attitude bears in itself a tendency
to become more radical and thereby to degenerate, if external
circumstances create an actual basis for it. We have experienced
the exaggeration of sound national ideas into national chauvinism,
and we can observe retrospectively how the sound soldierly idea
was exaggerated by influences foreign to its nature into the militaristic
form of expression. All these developments are not desultory,
which would make them easily recognizable and regulated.
The driving forces are mostly not apparent to those whom they
concern. They are like a poison which acts slowly and unnoticed
and the effect of which results one day in a horrible eruption.
It needs no special explanation that a component part of the
soldierly and military person who is being geared to a possible
war is ruggedness, and in its intensification it turns into brutality.
One often finds on the part of famous—and not only German—war
leaders the view that the brutal war is frequently the kindest
if it leads to a quick ending. This, of course, is desired by every
war leader. Once peaceful restraint is removed by war, all that
remains is brutality. It reveals the causes of total war and the
source of the terrible disaster which resulted from it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defense has a difficult task in this Trial. The German
people look to Nuremberg, disunited in themselves. Some are
skeptical and partly hostile toward the Defense because they
believe the Defense is favoring those whom they consider as war
criminals and believe that the Defense wishes to prevent that
just punishment be meted out to the defendants. Others say the
Trial is just a show, at which the Defense Counsel act as dummies
to give the Trial the appearance of a judicial procedure. Accordingly,
in the view of these Germans we would make ourselves
guilty of favoring the enemy.
<span class='pageno' title='609' id='Page_609'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>We have no reason to justify our actions because by our participation
at this Trial we are fulfilling a task in line with the
precept of our calling, the importance of which needs no justification.
It consists of co-ordinating our efforts in the interest of
clarifying the truth—the importance and effects of which is today
incalculable for our German people—of getting to the bottom
of the causes and of answering the question as to how all this
could have happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the clear recognition of the cause, the forces, and the
people which brought about the disaster which has come over
this world will create the possibility for the future of our people
to find the way back again to the rest of the world.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of this Tribunal is not to search for the political,
economic, and metaphysical reasons for this second World War
and not even to examine the course of events in its entirety, but
rather only to determine whether and what part these defendants
played in that which the victor nations made the object of these
proceedings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The task of the Defense, within the framework of their co-operation
in finding the truth, consists of examining which factual
and legal points could be stated in favor of the defendants. It
should be said here that with all the co-operation on the part of
the Tribunal shown to the Defense in producing their evidence,
the actual possibility of producing defense material for the defendants
was limited. Justice Jackson said in his basic prosecuting
speech...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: You seem to be coming back to further
attacks upon the way in which this case has been tried and that
is not what you are here to do now. What you are here to do
now is to present the case on behalf of the Defendant Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I see that further on here you go on to complain about alleged
noncommunication to you of various documents and you refer
to a discussion on the subject which took place as long ago as
February of 1946. On that occasion I expressed the view on behalf
of the Tribunal that the French Prosecution might properly show
to you or give you the opportunity to look at their documents.
From that day to this, that is to say from February until July,
you have made no application to the Tribunal or made any complaint
to the Tribunal that that has not been done; and now, in
your final speech, you make this complaint that you have not
been allowed to see the documents in spite of the fact that in
February I expressed, on behalf of the Tribunal, the opinion that
you might see such documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Well, it seems to me that it is a waste of time, a waste of our
time now to make these complaints after all these months, apart
<span class='pageno' title='610' id='Page_610'></span>
from the fact that you have already spent time which has been
involved in reading 11 pages of your speech without coming to
anything which really affects the Defendant Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, I believe that in February you told
the Prosecution, according to the record, that they should place
these documents at my disposal. The Prosecution, unfortunately,
have not placed these documents at my disposal.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why did you not come back to the Tribunal?
You knew perfectly well that I had expressed my opinion on
behalf of the Tribunal; and if there was anything to complain
about, you had full access to the Tribunal from February until
today. It seems to me that it is a frivolous complaint to come now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I hope, Mr. President, that nevertheless the facts
which I am putting to you in my manuscript will be considered
by the Tribunal. You will notice that I shall refer to this matter
at a later stage. On 1 February the session took place during
which this affair came up, and on 11 February I went to the French
Delegation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: That is what I have stated, Dr. Nelte. I have
already pointed that out to you.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: And the French Prosecution did not give it to me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Why did you not come back to the Tribunal
if you had any complaint to make? I have said—and I repeat—that
I think to make a complaint now after not having made it
for all these months is a frivolous complaint and an attempt to
create prejudice, and I should be glad of your explanation.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, it is merely an attempt to show
you that I did not wish to raise a complaint about the Prosecution,
recognizing as I did that the Prosecution did not want to help me.
I have never been inclined to raise complaints about higher authorities,
and I did not want to do it in this case either.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, I think that is a most unfair and
a most improper thing for a responsible counsel to say. I think
the mention of such a complaint is, as I have said, simply an effort
on your part to create prejudice against the French Prosecution
and against the fair conduct of this Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, in my view it was merely meant
to show how difficult it was for us to find material in favor of
our clients.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, perhaps you will try and get on to
something that is really material for the Tribunal to consider.
<span class='pageno' title='611' id='Page_611'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: May I ask you to turn to Page 15 where, under
Figure 3, I am dealing with the documents.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The document governs the hearing of evidence before this
Tribunal. Against that the witnesses remain in the background.
More important is the examination of these documents to ascertain
the possibility of their utilization and their probative value.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has submitted as evidence to a large extent
official reports which are admitted according to Article 21 of the
Charter. I intended to show with respect to a number of these
documents the conditional value of such reports as evidence. But
I shall limit myself to a few fundamental arguments in this connection,
trusting that you, Your Honors, in examining this kind
of evidence will take my statements into consideration.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These numerous official reports submitted contain factual statements
which to a great extent are based on witnesses’ testimony.
These testimonies are not always related in the form of protocols
but as summarizing reports. I do not want to dispute that these
testimonies of witnesses are made as deposed in the reports.
However, I will not do injustice to any of the witnesses who
are not known by the Tribunal and whose testimony is hard
to verify for lack of a personal impression, when I say that it
concerns mostly very subjective attestations. There are a number
of documents in which this is clearly recognizable, and in fact
stated, and even documents in which hatred finds its clear expression.
I can understand the hatred of these hard-hit people. The
suffering they had to endure was so great that one cannot expect
impartiality from them. I may, however, say too that such personal
feelings are not conducive to rendering the testimony of these
sorely afflicted ones a suitable basis for finding the real truth.
I am thinking of the form of oath so often heard here on the
part of the witnesses: “Swear that you will tell without hatred
or fear...” And these official reports often contain not only
factual statements, but final conclusions and judgments. To this
extent, the probative value of these official reports cannot be
recognized. In part these judgments go so far that outside the
sphere of those directly involved they level reproaches against
authorities, that is, the OKW and Keitel, without it being possible
to recognize from the document itself on what the conclusion drawn
rests. As long as it is a question of the indictment of an individual
like the Defendant Keitel, a document used in evidence must
give a proof which yields concrete facts for responsibility or which
at least reveals causal connection. Above all, it cannot suffice,
in order to consider Keitel’s responsibility as proved, if in such
reports crimes committed by soldiers and officers of the Army or
of the Armed Forces are alleged in order to derive responsibility
<span class='pageno' title='612' id='Page_612'></span>
on the part of the Defendant Keitel from this fact alone, because
he was the Chief of Staff of the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It must be added that in these reports military agencies have
often been erroneously named and confused; for example, when
the Defendant Keitel is spoken of as the “High Commander (Oberkommandierender)
of the Wehrmacht,” which is called “OKW”
instead of “OKH.” It is not always possible to decide to what
extent it is a question of an erroneous conception on the part of
the Prosecution or whether it comes from a translation which is
not in accordance with the meaning.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to examine the responsibility of the Defendant Keitel,
I wish to make clear to the Tribunal, in a manner which excludes
any doubt, what the channels of command and competence were
and to this end I have submitted two affidavits to the Court:
a) “The Channels of Command in the East” (Document Book 2,
Keitel-10); b) “The Development of the Situation in France 1940-1945
and the Military Authorities” (Document Book 2, Keitel-13).
The latter affidavit has also been signed by the Codefendant Jodl.
I refer to these affidavits and make them the contents of my
argument without reading from them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Finally I would like to direct the attention of the Tribunal toward other
circumstances which may well impair the probative value of the documents
which the Prosecution has submitted and you have accepted—for example,
when documents do not bear any signatures, and it is impossible to decide
whether it is a question of copies of documents which have actually been
issued. As an example I will refer to Document 081-PS, which was submitted
by the Prosecution for Keitel’s Indictment during the question of the treatment
of prisoners of war. As far as its contents are concerned it is a fabulous
document. Keitel does not remember ever having seen this report or ever
having knowledge of the details contained in it. From all appearances one must
consider this document as the draft of a report which was not issued, for:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>a) it bears neither a signature nor an initial as is usual in copies,</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>b) if this letter had been sent out, it would have a blank journal number; and</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>c) the letter was not found at the addressee’s. In such cases mere knowledge of
the addressee—in this case the Defendant Keitel—and the consequent deduction
of his guilt in omitting to take measures to change conditions cannot be considered
as proved.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I come to the Indictment against Field Marshal Keitel. I shall
shorten the reading of Pages 19 to 21. The reading of the general
Indictment and the special Indictment in the trial briefs can be
omitted here since, with the exception of the Jewish problem
and the persecution of the Church, there is no part of the Indictment
which the Prosecution has not raised against the Defendant
Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I should wish merely to point out that the original general
Indictment holds Keitel responsible only for the period after 1938
and secondly, that at the beginning of the Indictment, Keitel is
described as Chief of Army Command. According to the evidence
submitted by the Prosecution, Keitel was also held responsible
<span class='pageno' title='613' id='Page_613'></span>
for the period after 1933, although the American, British, and
French Prosecutions seem to have dropped the allegation that
Keitel was Chief of Army Command. The Indictment of Field
Marshal Keitel is split, therefore, between the periods 1933 to
1938—that is, 4 February 1938—and from 4 February 1938 until
the end.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now continue on Page 21, the last paragraph.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Herewith the defendant is not only indicted as a member of
the conspiracy but is also accused of personally participating in
all the crimes in the Indictment. The space which the Prosecution
has devoted to the defendant in its statements corresponds with
the comprehensive Indictments. The name of no other defendant
has been mentioned so often by the Prosecution as that of the
Defendant Keitel. Again and again we hear the words “Keitel’s
order,” “Keitel’s decree,” and just as often “order of the OKW,”
“directives of the OKW,” along with Keitel’s name as “Chief,
OKW” after 4 February 1938.</p>

<p class='pindent'>From this is derived the very substance of the Indictment,
namely, the position the Defendant Keitel occupied after 4 February
1938. But from it is also derived the scope of the justification.
Here it is not a question of examining to what extent the defendant
participated in the individual facts of the case, which in the
long run arose from the so-called “Keitel orders” or “OKW
instructions”; but what matters is the position he occupied—whether
he took part and what part he took in the planning
and execution of those orders and instructions, and finally and
most important of all, whether his part in it was causal and culpable
in the sense of the law which is to be applied here.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It seems to be of importance to stress from the outset several
points of view which are important for the treatment of the case
and for its judgment.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Would that be a convenient time to
break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>The Tribunal recessed until 1400 hours.</span>]</h3>

<hr class='pbk'/>

<h2><span class='pageno' title='614' id='Page_614'></span><span class='it'>Afternoon Session</span></h2>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: The defendant has declared that he admits the
objective, that is, the factual contents of the general Indictment to
have been proved (that is to say, not every individual point), taking
into consideration the law of procedure governing this Trial. It
would therefore be senseless, despite the possibility of refuting
various documents or individual facts, to attempt to shake the Indictment
as a whole. Therefore, I shall confine myself mainly to
the questions concerning the subjective facts and the conspiracy,
and I will treat only these individual points which require treatment
because of their special importance concerning the personal
participation of the Defendant Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The disproportion between the import of past events and the
defendant’s fate as an individual is so great that the Defendant
Keitel, even if not impelled by conscience, must have known after
reflection that such a course on my part would lay him open to the
suspicion that he was fighting here for his life. But the defendant
has already made it quite clear in his argument that he is not
fighting to save his head, but fighting to save face.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The defendant belongs to those men who came into the public
eye through Adolf Hitler’s death. From 1938 onward he was in his
closest circle and was his almost constant companion. It is clear to
him what that means for this Trial. It has often been alleged by
the Prosecution that by referring to the dead the defendants desired
to unload their own responsibility upon them. If it is the purpose of
this Trial to obtain the most faithful picture possible of events and
connections, it is not fair to start out by discrediting any mention
of those who are dead, and who—as the Prosecution also know—are
the major culprits. This is especially true of the Defendant
Keitel, whose position, influence, and actions cannot possibly be
judged correctly without throwing light upon the person of Adolf
Hitler and upon his relationship with Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As can already be seen from Mr. Justice Jackson’s opening
statement, we are dealing here with an indictment against the
National Socialist system. Actually, the Indictment is a global indictment
against this system, split up into 21 individual indictments.
The individual defendants are, to a certain extent, mere symbolic
figures of the spheres of authority of the State which was ruled
by this system: namely, Party, Government, and Armed Forces. If
I understand Mr. Justice Jackson correctly, he goes even further
in saying:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Above all personal forces are nameless and impersonal
fores; their conflict with each other makes up much of
<span class='pageno' title='615' id='Page_615'></span>
humanity’s history.... What are the real forces which are
battling here in front of you?”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>This statement raises a problem which, Gentlemen of the Tribunal,
cannot be left unmentioned at this Trial, a problem which
M. de Menthon also pointed out: The importance and influence of
those forces which shape fate. Fate and guilt are not two poles
which exclude each other from their respective spheres; they are
areas which overlap so that there are spheres of life and spheres of
activity in which the interplay of these two forces make the world
move. One can only hint briefly here as to what forces are at work
which shape fate, that is to say, what forces cannot be considered
as originating in the conscious will of the individual defendants:
The sense of national unity, historic events, opinions which are
rooted in tradition and environment. Therefore, I will have to go
into this background insofar as it is relevant to the Defendant Keitel
as a person and as a type of one of the groups under the Indictment,
because thus only will you be given the possibility of obtaining a
correct picture of the share which the Defendant Keitel had in what
has happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I also want to state that everything I am about to say is said
with the full agreement of the Defendant Keitel; and insofar as
aspects and facts are stated which might exonerate the Defendant
Keitel, they should be taken as a contribution toward the clarification
of what has happened, and as an answer to the question of how
things could have reached that point. He does not wish to have his
position or the part which he played in this drama minimized, but
he is anxious at the same time to avoid giving a distorted picture
of his character. The defendant has already stated on the witness
stand that he was grateful for the opportunity this Trial afforded
him to give an account to the world public and the German people
of what he did and why he did it. He wishes to help in ascertaining
the historical truth of what happened.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I consider it my obligation to express this opinion of the Defendant
Keitel because this attitude, based on such reasons, made it
considerably easier for me to conduct his defense. It was, and is,
clear to the Defendant Keitel that if one considers the horrible
consequences and monstrous deeds which—without here raising the
question of guilt—undoubtedly were committed by German people,
and which can indisputably be traced back to orders and directives
with which Keitel came into contact in some form, then one will
experience a feeling of guilt, without considering whether this is
guilt in the legal sense or the tragic feeling of being linked by fate
with the causes and thereby also the consequences.
<span class='pageno' title='616' id='Page_616'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution has maintained that:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“At one time all the defendants had banded together with
the Nazi Party for a plan which they well knew could be
realized only by the outbreak of a war in Europe.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>With regard to the Defendant Keitel, it is said that from 1933
on he took active part in this conspiracy.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To prove its thesis the Prosecution stated:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) that the National Socialist program in itself, according to its
wording and meaning, could be realized only by using force;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) that the Defendant Keitel recognized, or should have
recognized this;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(c) that recognizing this he, together with the others, especially
the co-defendants, planned and prepared aggressive wars.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards these statements, I would like to call the Tribunal’s
attention, first of all, to the principal part of Mr. Justice Jackson’s
bill of Indictment, in which he deals with the program of the Party.
He mentions there a number of points of the program, about which
he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Naturally, these were all aims which were legally unimpeachable.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>At a different point he says:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I do not criticize this policy; I wish it were generally
recognized. Naturally, this acknowledging criticism is subject
to the one limitation: As long as these aims would be achieved
without an aggressive war.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>According to that, the Prosecution itself do not assume that the
wording and meaning of the Party program were such that normal
persons would recognize that these Party political aims could be
realized by use of force only. I do not wish to repeat what in this
connection was said by the individual defendants at their hearings
in court. Especially convincing appeared to me what Dr. Schacht
stated on this subject. He concludes his critical examination of the
important points of the Party program with these words:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“These are essentially the contents of the National Socialist
Party Program, and I cannot find that anything criminal lies
therein.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I quote this statement especially because it shows how this
program and its recognizable objectives affected a person who
may be characterized as intelligent, realistic, free from emotional
impulses in politics, and possessing economic penetration and judgment.
If that person did not recognize that the Party aims were
to be realized by use of force, how was the soldier Keitel to come
to such a realization?
<span class='pageno' title='617' id='Page_617'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel was a professional officer. As such he could not be a
member of the Party. Officers were prohibited from any political
and Party political activity. The Armed Forces command was
intent on keeping the influence of Party politics away from the
Armed Forces. This was true both for the time before 1933 and
afterward. Hitler himself confirmed this principle because he clearly
recognized that the time was not yet ripe for giving the corps of
officers, let alone the senior officers, a political character. According
to the tradition and conception of their profession, those senior
officers had a “national attitude,” as one used to say, and they
welcomed the national points of the program which were placed
in the foreground by Hitler; they were glad about the co-operation
of the Armed Forces and without hesitation placed themselves
behind the Government led by Hitler when it proclaimed the fight
against the Treaty of Versailles, especially against its military
political clauses. An agreement going beyond these aims, or possibly
a union with a political object in view, did not exist. The generals,
among them also Keitel, thought no differently from millions of
Germans who were not Party members or who were opponents, but
who regarded the national aims as being a matter of course.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, one cannot fail to see that it is somewhat different if
millions of Germans, who had no influence, supported that part of
the program relating to the national aims, or if the senior officers,
who led the Armed Forces, support it. Furthermore, it cannot be
overlooked that the realization of these national aims carried with
it the danger of a war. But the state of things seems to me to be
such that the generals saw the danger of war not so much in the
fact that Hitler wanted to realize these national aims by an aggressive
war, but rather in the fact that the realization of these aims
would entail sanctions by the former enemy powers. The idea of
a realization by aggressive, warlike means was far from the generals’
minds for the absolutely compelling reason of military impotency.
I shall later deal more in detail with this problem, which
is closely connected with the rearmament. Here it is only important
that the circles to which Keitel belonged—and I should like to add,
between 1933 and 1938—</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) had no contact with the Party program;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) had no relationship with Party circles;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) sympathized with a part of the Party program because it
corresponded to their national attitude;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) did not think of realizing these national points by an aggressive
war, because it would have been hopeless from the military
point of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now one could argue that although the generals themselves did
not think of waging an aggressive war, they certainly recognized,
<span class='pageno' title='618' id='Page_618'></span>
or should have recognized, that Hitler had the intention, if not now,
then in the near future, of waging an aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution believes it can be presumed that the Defendant
Keitel had this knowledge from 1933 on. The argument of the
Prosecution that this knowledge is equivalent to knowledge of the
National Socialist program has been refuted; the same holds true
of the knowledge of the book <span class='it'>Mein Kampf</span>—assuming he possessed
the book. Therefore, the question is only whether Keitel had knowledge
of Hitler’s intentions regarding an aggression for other reasons.
For the period up to 1938 Keitel could not have obtained knowledge
from Hitler himself because Keitel spoke with him late in January
1938 for the first time. The speeches which Hitler made before that
time, just as those of the other Party leaders, were unambiguously
aimed at preserving peace. Looking back, one might call it propagandistic
camouflage of opposite intentions. If that were the case,
then this camouflage successfully deceived not only many millions
of Germans, but also the foreign countries which were partly
critical and partly hostile toward National Socialism.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel believed the protestations of peaceful intentions, and saw
their honesty confirmed also by official proposals of disarmament
and treaties with England and Poland. He believed them all the
more because, as has already been said, an aggressive war appeared
to him an impossibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Codefendant Von Neurath too, frequently declared here that
all his information and knowledge of Hitler’s policy up to 5 November
1937 justified his firm conviction that Hitler did not want to
realize his political aims by force or aggressive wars. It was only
by the speech of 5 November 1937 that this conviction of Von
Neurath’s was shaken.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the arguments in Dr. Schacht’s defense to which I referred,
those facts were presented which show a contradiction between the
former conduct of the victorious powers and the thesis which the
Prosecution advances on this question.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Through their official relations and beyond these, the victorious
powers showed that, despite their knowledge of all the circumstances
of which the defendants are now being accused, they, that
is, the victors, did not believe in Hitler’s intentions, or did not
recognize these intentions of realizing his aims by aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Prosecution now makes the accusation against the defendant
that he knew, or ought to have known, such intentions of Hitler.
This is not convincing, and I can leave it to the Tribunal to judge
who—if all contingencies are taken into consideration—had better
possibilities of obtaining information on Hitler’s true intentions.
I believe the Defendant Keitel may claim for himself the same good
<span class='pageno' title='619' id='Page_619'></span>
faith and the same ignorance, unless such knowledge or participation
itself results from other circumstances.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such circumstances during the years 1933 through 1938 may have
concerned Keitel’s activity in connection with rearmament and in
the Reich Defense Committee. The charge of illegal rearmament
includes two facts which have been summed up by the Prosecution:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Secret rearmament by circumventing the Treaty of Versailles;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Rearmament with the purpose of planning wars of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For a judicial consideration, however, these facts must be kept
strictly apart; for they are different with respect to cause and
effect, and they must also be legally assessed from different points
of view.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The time between 1933 and 1938 is the fateful period, a period
of development and conversion. The forces of the hitherto existing
order are struggling against the new which have not yet taken
definite shape. Everything is in fermentation. The aims remain
obscure. They are camouflaged by the adoption of existing nationalistic
tendencies. By clever propagandistic utilization of these
tendencies, the psychological basis for the aims pursued by the
new rulers is being created without being noticed by those whom
it concerned. Here lies the problem of the Armed Forces leadership
and of the Defendant Keitel during this period with which
I am going to deal now.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This problem cannot be solved without taking into consideration
Germany’s military position. In judging the then Colonel Keitel
another consideration enters the picture: how the special sphere to
which he belonged was affected by this situation. Keitel considered
the Treaty of Versailles, and especially the military clauses, as a
humiliation for Germany. He considered it a duty toward his
country to collaborate in putting an end to this situation. He was
convinced that the Treaty of Versailles, because of its impossible
military and territorial stipulations, would have to be revised some
day. Such a revision appeared to him imperative, in the interest
of justice as well as of reason, if a lasting world peace was to be
preserved. On the basis of this conviction he believed that as a
German and a soldier, he was entitled, in the official capacities in
which he acted during this period, to interpret the military stipulations
of the Versailles Treaty literally, even if this was in contradiction
to the spirit of the stipulation. His justification for this
was that the stipulations limited the possibilities of development
in an unbearable manner, that is, in a manner altogether insufficient
for an effective defense. Though he did not participate personally,
<span class='pageno' title='620' id='Page_620'></span>
he did not consider it wrong for Germany, under the given circumstances,
to construct submarines in Finland, not for herself, but for
the purpose of gathering experience and training specialists; or to
maintain construction and designing offices in Amsterdam in order
to observe the progress achieved in the field of aeronautics and to
make use of it without actually building planes. Symptomatic of
the way democratic Germany of that time thought—without consideration
of position and party—was Dr. Brüning’s statement which
on 15 February 1932 was broadcast over all U.S.A. radio stations
on the occasion of the meeting of the disarmament conference. I
am going to quote some passages from that speech:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The inner-political fights in Germany are very bitter in their
outward forms, to be sure; but this must not lead one to
overlook the fact that despite many differences there exist
indisputably many things in common also. On the two
decisive foreign-political questions of today, the questions of
disarmament and reparations, uniform opinions prevail
among the German people. The demand for equal rights
and equal security is shared by the entire German people.
Every German Government will have to uphold these
demands. That the fight of the parties as to the road which
our politics must take is perhaps more bitter in Germany
today than in some other countries, is a result of the deep
misery which weighs heavily upon Germany and greatly
burdens the people’s soul.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In connection with this point I also refer to the testimony which
the Codefendant Von Neurath gave on 22 June 1946. These words
which Brüning spoke prove that there was a demand which was
upheld by the entire people irrespective of the difference in parties:
The demand for equal rights and equal security. The objection to
that is: A demand, even if upheld by the entire people, does not in
itself create the right to violate or circumvent established regulations.
In principle, one can accept that. However, things were
not as simple as that. I do not wish to harp upon a fundamental
law applying to all countries and giving every nation the right to
create for itself a certain state of defense. But even if one is not
prepared to recognize such a fundamental law, one will still perhaps
understand the state of emergency which actually exists when
a country is so limited in its military potential that it is not only
liable to military attack by any neighbor but also condemned to
political impotency.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In the course of the hearing of evidence the Tribunal has had
occasion to recognize that this was true with regard to the situation
in which Germany found herself in the year 1933. I want to call
your attention to the following passages of the Field Marshal’s
<span class='pageno' title='621' id='Page_621'></span>
report which was submitted to the Tribunal. The following passages,
written by this outstanding soldier, summarize as follows
the experience of a patriotic and military life as regards the point
discussed here under the title “Rearmament”:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Nature is inclined to pass over weak people. The law that
only the strong survive is generally recognized...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>I quote further:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The world does not take seriously the wishes of the weak.
Weakness is too great a temptation for the strong.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>And finally I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Above all, it seems to me, we must correct the tragic misunderstanding
that a policy directed at security is a war
policy.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The best witness with regard to this question, which is so important
for the Defendant Keitel, is the book by a British Major
General, A. C. Temperley, (Publishers Collins, 1938) <span class='it'>The Whispering-Gallery
of Europe</span>, for which the British Foreign Secretary of the
second World War, Mr. Anthony Eden, wrote a very friendly, concurring
preface.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, wouldn’t it be possible for you to
pass over the reading of these passages which come from the book
of Major General Temperley? The Tribunal will take notice of
them. There are quite a number of long speeches from the book.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I intended to ask the Tribunal whether it would
kindly take judicial notice of these passages if I submit them.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>They carry particular weight because Temperley reports and judges retrospectively
from the year of 1936.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The statements made by Temperley, who witnessed the disarmament conference,
the official negotiations and the negotiations behind the scenes, are
deeply moving because they reveal the tragic—I must use the word—fateful—and
primary conflict: fateful because the thesis presented by the representatives
of the different countries—which was derived from the national, given
conditions and from traditionally bound conceptions—proved that the difficulties
could not be overcome and thus formed the origin of the confusion the last
consequences of which we have just experienced. Temperley says:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>1) (Page 50) “The French had studied the question of disarmament much
more thoroughly than any other nation, and some of their best brains
of the General Staff and Naval Staff had examined the problem for
months... To characterize their problem roughly, it was their goal
to disarm themselves as little as possible although they were the strongest
power of the world, but at the same time to keep Germany in a state
of disarmament down to the minutest detail according to the conditions
of the peace treaty</span>...</p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(Page 71) “In the report which I gave, I spared neither the French nor
us. We had made big mistakes, but at that time I came to recognize
that in reality the French never thought of disarming at all... M. Paul
Boncour certainly was honest and worked intensively in order to achieve
success, but the pressure of the French General Staff upon the Government
was too great</span>...
<span class='pageno' title='622' id='Page_622'></span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>2) (Page 126) “Mr. Stresemann knew his people best. It was a race against
time. How long could he keep his people in an atmosphere of cooperative
acquiescence without any tangible success in the form of concessions
on the part of the Allies? Ought the Allied Governments to
have given faster and more willingly what they were ready to give?
Would this gesture have prevented the catastrophe?... Doubtless, history
will provide the answer. I do not know what kind of an answer it is
going to be, but it seems certain to me that the most important period,
when Germany turned away from the road of peace, will be found to
be the period of co-operation between 1929 and 1930... Would a less
hesitating policy as regards the cancellation of the debts, economic reconstruction,
and concessions in the treaties have prevented Hitlerism and
all its consequences? Who knows?... In his <span class='gesp'>Review of International
Affairs</span>, 1930, Professor Arnold Toynbee writes: ‘For the
foreign observer who visited Germany at that time it was a terrible and
strange drama to see a whole nation—one of the greatest and most
civilized nations of the world—engaged in a heroic struggle against fate,
half paralyzed already in titanic battle, driven by the conviction that its
steps had already irresistibly been led on to the path of destruction.’
(Pages 128 and 129) “The German people had lost hope... The French
had always contended that Germany would maintain a pretext of modesty
as long as the Rhineland was occupied, and that when the occupation
ceased the true color would show... This has proved to be a good prediction,
yet it was a concurrence of circumstances and the expression of
a people taking its last gasp rather than premeditated planning</span>...</p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>3) (Page 151) “I was present at the session and was profoundly moved in
the face of the attitude of the French delegation and that of the Little
Entente. They believed that they now had Germany financially by the
throat and that her utter ruin was only a question of weeks. Our Foreign
Office recognized the situation. Yet after a discussion with Henderson I
ask myself whether he really did recognize the abyss which was gaping
before us</span>...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Perhaps one certain passage might be of interest, on Page 38,
under (4):</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I also name the general staffs, because there is no greater
illusion than that they, taken as a whole, are in favor of
war. I know the general staffs of many countries very well,
and have never known any general staff which would have
glorified war or would have wished for war. They knew too
much about it. If they advocated strength, it was because
they believed in the idea that armed strength can prevent war.</p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>“In opposition to the bloodthirsty pacifists who reject modern weapons, but
who immediately clamor for their presence on the battlefield when one
must resist attackers... This leads to the conclusion that armaments are
not the main reason for wars. The history of the years 1926 to 1931 is not
that of a race for rearmament, but that of a slowly developing deterioration
of the international situation because of the economic and political
chaos, which made disarmament impossible and rearmament unavoidable...</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(Page 222) “The Germans actually repeated their successful tactics in circumventing
treaties, the very tactics they had used in Napoleon’s time.
And yet, one wonders what other honor-loving nation in the same circumstances
would not also have done its utmost to circumvent a treaty
which had been forced upon it at the point of the bayonet</span>...</p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(Page 232) “The following 6 months brought Germany’s return, Hoover’s
failure and that of the French plans, and the complete change in the
atmosphere through Hitler’s seizure of power. However dreadful this was
for the peace of the world—the other powers, above all France, have only
themselves to blame for it... We should have exerted more pressure upon
the French and made greater efforts to keep a moderate government in
office in Germany.</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(Page 256) “...they felt they were still being treated as outlaws</span>...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='623' id='Page_623'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I would like to ask that these opinions of the British general which, as I already
said, had the approval of the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Anthony Eden, be taken
into consideration. In this connection I want to refer also to the statements by
the following statesmen: Paul Boncour, Henderson, Briand, and Cecil; these statements
were submitted by Dr. Schacht’s defense (Schacht Document Book Number 3,
Exhibit Schacht-12) on the same subject matter and were accepted by the Tribunal;
I also want to refer to the book by Viscount Rothermere: <span class='gesp'>Warnings
and Predictions</span> (Page 100).</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In examining and deciding whether the Defendant Keitel
knowingly violated the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles
in the meaning of the Indictment, the Tribunal will have to consider
the facts which have been presented. Individual charges against
him on this point have not been made.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is unquestionable that from 1933 on rearmament took place
in the Reich. The Defendant Keitel has admitted that, and he stated
that in the official positions he held up to 30 September 1934 and
from 1 October 1935 on he participated in this rearmament in
accordance with the functions incumbent on him. Like everything
the Germans do, the rearmament too was well thought-out and
organized. The Prosecution collected data for that; especially Document
Number 2353-PS and the transcripts of the sessions of the
Reich Defense Committee.</p>

<p class='pindent'>During the hearing of evidence the total picture of this period
from 1935 to 1938 was not clearly defined. The Prosecution
arranged its presentation of evidence retrospectively and drew a
conclusion from the results of the war as to the motive for the
rearmament, but at the same time it deduced from the fact, which
cannot be denied and has not been denied, that this rearmament
could not have been planned and carried out by any one man, that
it constituted a joint plot for the purpose of aggressive war.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, where is the decisive criterion: in military armament or in
other preparations for war from which the conclusion may be
drawn that these measures have an aggressive character, that is to
say, that they aim at an aggressive war? In principle, from armament
itself nothing can be deduced as to the alleged intentions;
armament may, in fact it must, look just the same if carried out
for security and defense as it would if applied to aggressive war.
Therefore, if the intention of rearmament for the purpose of a plot
is to be determined, distinction must be made between:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) Armament and preventive measures which must be taken in
case a mobilization should become necessary for defense at any time;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) Rearmament and enacting of measures which exceed, in
quantity or quality, the volume under (a) to such an extent that
the intention of the political leadership to begin a war will be
recognized by those concerned, in which case the political question
of whether an aggressive, defensive, or preventive war is intended
<span class='pageno' title='624' id='Page_624'></span>
may be disregarded. Therefore, in the end, the decisive question
will be whether in connection with these measures the intention of
planning for an aggressive war was expressed or had become otherwise
noticeable, or whether the measures, because of their nature
and volume, demand the conclusive deduction that an aggressive
war was being prepared.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In retrospect, the events are presented as the logical chain of a
development according to plan. In reality, not only Hitler’s far-reaching
intentions and his planning were subject to an actual
course of events in which, objectively viewed, a certain causality
seems to be inherent, but the knowledge and approving support of
co-operating circles were equally subject to this. There can be no
dispute over the statement that the economic capacity of a country,
which in its totality must be regarded as armament for the case of
war, will eventually get to a point which must be considered of
decisive importance in solving the question of when the rearmament,
that is, the status of the entire industry essential for war, exceeds
the capacity of armament for defense.</p>

<p class='pindent'>While considering this, it must be taken into account, especially
for the Defendant Keitel as a soldier, that until he took over the
office of Chief of OKW on 4 February he had not held an important
position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, what part did the Defendant Keitel play at that time,</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) In the field of rearmament with regard to material and
personnel;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) in the field of administrative and—as charged by the Prosecution—military-political
rearmament as dealt with under the
heading of the Reich Defense Council?</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall now skip Pages 43 to 46, since they contain the historical
development of the organizational principles, and I beg the Tribunal,
if it can make use of this information, to consider it in reaching a
verdict. I shall continue on Page 47.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>When on 1 October 1935 the Defendant Keitel became the Chief of the High
Command of the German Armed Forces in the Reich Ministry of Von Blomberg,
there was a Military Economy Branch headed by Colonel Thomas. He was appointed
by Von Blomberg as an expert adviser for the organization.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>This Military Economy Branch, later called the Military Economy Staff, as
a ministerial service post had to represent the Reich Minister of War with the
competent and authoritative economy posts, later also with the Plenipotentiary
General for Economy (GB), nominated in 1935. The Minister of War, Von Blomberg,
generally communicated directly with Thomas at the time when Field
Marshal Keitel was Chief of the Armed Forces Department.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>To clarify the part Keitel had in the organizational development of rearmament
in this period, I would explain the following:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>I. The position at the start in 1933 (for the period 1933-38) was as follows: Lack
of any kind of basis for production as a consequence of the destruction of the
armament industry following the Treaty of Versailles.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Consequence: no capacity for production, no motor vehicles, no mechanical
equipment, no offices for construction, no experience.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='625' id='Page_625'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Thus, the first stage for rearmament: the restoration of a basis for production,
and equipment and reconversion of factories.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>II. Basic initial factors to procure armaments:</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(a) Branches of the Armed Forces, in Issuing orders to firms through their ordnance
offices as purchasing agents, were handicapped by budget means and their
incorporation in the budget year.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Consequence: Subsidizing of firms for lack of long term orders and through the
impossibility of calculation.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(b) War Economy Office in the OKW as the central organizer and representative
of the producer firms through War Economy (later Armament) Inspectorates as
intermediary offices in the military area, to serve the branches of the Armed
Forces as executive. Duties of the organization, which was run by a military staff:</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(1) To gain information about and recommend firms to the military branches.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(2) To adjust the orders of the military branches to the capacity.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(3) To provide for the allotment of raw materials, machinery, and manpower.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(4) To further the extension and capacity of industrial plants.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(5) To protect the plants from bad investments, air raids, espionage, et cetera.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(c) The Plenipotentiary for Economy, GBW, as from the autumn of 1935 was
the declared organizer of the entire German economy for its mobilization in
case of war and its prospective leader during a war.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>His duties in peacetime were preparatory only:</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>1. Statistical co-ordination of the individual industrial and economic branches,
including the armament authorities connected with the OKW, and the War
Economy office under Thomas.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>2. Provision and storing of raw materials obtainable by importation only.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>3. Procurement of foreign currencies for importation.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>4. Financing of domestic rearmament.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>5. Planning of reconversion of the entire economy to war needs, and extension
of the special armament industry.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>6. Duties as mentioned already under II (b), (3), and (4), together with the War
Economy office in the OKW.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In addition to this, but planned to take effect only in case of mobilization,
there was collaboration with the following subordinate ministries: a) Ministry of
Economics, b) Ministry of Food, c) Ministry of Labor, d) Ministry of Finance, for
foreign exchange and purchase of raw materials, e) Ministry of Forestry.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>This necessitated, from December 1935 onward, the participation of a GBW deputy
for purposes of information in the Belch Defense Commission.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>After Dr. Schacht’s retirement from the Reich Ministry of Economics, the GBW
became only fiction, because the full powers had been transferred to the Four
Year Plan, that is to say, Göring. Only when the powers of the ministry of
armament and munitions were extended in August 1943, when it became known
as the Ministry for Armament and War Production, was there a revival of the
originally planned position of the GBW entailing full powers in time of war,
but he remained subordinate as regards organization to the Four Year Plan,
with the Führer as the general authority in reality at the top, owing to the
failure of the Four Year Plan.</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>III. In collaboration of the GBW with the War Economy Office in the OKW
the “Mobilization Plan for Rearmament” had been set up, with General Thomas
presiding. This “Mobilization Plan for Rearmament” acted on behalf of the Armed
Forces and the GBW who supplied particulars of the industrial plants to be
assigned from general production for reconversion to armament production in
time of war. It was to attend to:</span></p>

<p class='noindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(a) labor requirements, (b) raw material requirements, and (c) industrial equipment
(special machinery for weapons, et cetera).</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The prerequisite of modern warfare is not so much the exploitation
and organization of the manpower of a country into military
formations, but it is essentially a problem of industrial capacity
<span class='pageno' title='626' id='Page_626'></span>
and of its appropriate utilization for the production of all necessary
raw materials. This process must of necessity precede any rearmament,
and requires expenditure of money and, even more, of time.</p>

<p class='pindent'>When Germany proclaimed her equal rights as regards defense—that
is, military sovereignty—she did not possess the necessary
resources for a material rearmament, as they had been taken away
in the execution and recognition of the disarmament plan. It has
been confirmed here during the Trial by various sources that first
10, then 7 to 8 years were allowed and anticipated for providing
material equipment in the form of hitherto prohibited modern
weapons and supplies, especially including munitions, for the
peacetime Armed Forces which had been announced to the world
with the proclamation of liberty for national defense in 1935. This
becomes comprehensible if one considers that even the U.S.A. with
its unlimited means, which were not impaired by the effects of war,
required 4 to 5 years for the necessary conversion and rearmament
in this war. Thus we see that rearmament, if it is intended to
exceed the limits of defensive armament, can only be achieved
gradually in the case of nations, which—like Germany in 1934—had
no armaments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one considers that in 1934 Germany had no modern weapons,
no submarines, and no military aircraft at her disposal, it can well
be believed that any reasonable soldier had to assume under the
given circumstances there could be no thought of a war, let alone
a war of aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Accordingly, the tasks which the Defendant Keitel assumed in
his official capacity of Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Department
must be considered as purely preparatory and organizational.
Keitel, of course, bears the responsibility for General Thomas,
Chief of the Defense Economy Staff. The technical details and the
<span class='pageno' title='627' id='Page_627'></span>
extent of his activity can be seen from Document 2353-PS, which
is correct in essence despite the fact that Thomas, in the declaration
prefixed to this historical document, now wants it to look as if he
had presented his original notes in an exaggerated way and given
them a more favorable turn to please Hitler and avoid arrest. This
does not correspond to the facts. What Thomas wrote proves,
according to the Defendant Keitel’s opinion, that a “war armament”
with mobilization of the industrial capacity and its conversion to
war economy did not begin until early in October 1939. It further
proves that the statements of the defendants who were examined
here, as far as they were connected with this rearmament, and
especially those of Dr. Schacht until 1937, are in complete agreement
on the following point: At this period wars of aggression were
not avowedly desired, and that in the light of the state of actual
armament they must have appeared impossible.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But rearmament in manpower also shows the same picture
during this period. The evidence has demonstrated that up to the
spring of 1938 only 27 peacetime divisions were scantily equipped
and that 10 or 12 reserve divisions were in preparation; at that time
the Wehrmacht had no other supplies or armaments at its disposal.
If despite this fact, and operating without general mobilization, it
succeeded by the autumn of 1938 in preparing an army of almost
40 divisions for the aggression against Czechoslovakia, at a time
when it had the poorest protection on its western border, one can
see what the maximum war potential was in those days.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Under such circumstances, and with knowledge of the armament
situation and war potentials of neighboring countries which were
mutually united by alliances and assistance pacts, none of the
generals of the old school could ever think of bringing about a war.
The fact that already one year later, in 1939, the state of German
armaments was substantially improved, must primarily be attributed
to the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Finally it must be
pointed out that during this period there was no strategic plan for
any aggression whatsoever. General Jodl has declared on the
witness stand that when in 1935 he came to the Armed Forces
Department, no plan nor anything similar was in existence, except
what was provided for in case of internal unrest. The occupation
of the demilitarized Rhineland zone was not planned, but was
improvised by Hitler. The <span class='it'>Initial Assembly and Combat Directives</span>
of June 1937 is a general instruction for possible military
conflicts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>For the sake of completeness I must also call attention to Document
EC-194. This is an order issued by the Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces, Von Blomberg, on the subject of aerial reconnaissance
and the observation of submarine movements during the
<span class='pageno' title='628' id='Page_628'></span>
occupation of the Rhine. Keitel signed and forwarded this order.
It is the only existent document of that period.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reichswehr had a permanent force of 100,000 men, as had
been laid down by the Treaty of Versailles. It is indisputable that
in view of the size of the Reich, its unprotected borders and the
way East Prussia was cut off, this figure was absolutely inadequate
for creating a feeling of internal security and the possibility of
defense in the face of an attack from the outside world—an
elementary right for any country and nation. This state of inadequacy,
which had been created by the military clauses of the Treaty
of Versailles, was the subject of reflection even before 1933 with a
view to improving it without actually making use of soldiers for
the purpose. An examination was made and it was found that in
case of mobilization a series of tasks could be taken over by the
civil ministries. Here tasks of a purely defensive nature were
concerned, which cannot be considered aggressive. They were tasks
of national defense, and principally the following: I have enumerated
them in my manuscript and, without reading them, I would
like the High Tribunal to take judicial notice of these points. As
it is quite clear these are matters for defense only.</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(1) Protection of the frontiers by reinforcement of the customs service;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(2) Postal security by Reichspost agencies (repeater offices);</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(3) Railroad protection by Reichsbahn personnel;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(4) Laying of cables instead of overhead telegraph lines;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(5) Construction of railroad viaducts and elimination of level crossings on
main traffic roads;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(6) Construction of frontier fortifications in the East, Oder-Warthe line,
Pomeranian line, Oder line (terrain expropriation);</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(7) Improvement of maritime traffic with East Prussia and of rail transit
through the Corridor;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(8) Fortifications in East Prussia;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(9) Reinforcement of frontier protection in East Prussia;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(10) Preparation by the Reichsbahn of mobile loading ramps;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(11) Reinforcement of the coastal customs service;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(12) Development by the Reichspost of the radio network (amplified transmitters
and receivers);</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(13) Manning of permanent army signal stations with Reichspost personnel;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(14) Relieving the Reichswehr from the charge of detaching soldiers for duties
which can be carried out by civilian personnel;</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(15) Protection of frontier crossings by the local authorities (Landräte);</span></p>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>(16) Co-ordination of motor vehicles, et cetera.</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The advisory body for these tasks and their execution was, up to
1933, the Committee of Experts. It consisted of experts coming from
the different civil ministries, who after being accepted by the
Minister of the Interior—Severing, up to the end of 1933—met for
conferences at the Reich Defense Ministry. The Reichswehr Minister
charged the then Colonel Keitel to direct these meetings. At these
meetings the experts received and discussed the desires of the
Reich Defense Ministry as regards the afore-mentioned tasks, which
the individual ministers could take over in case of a mobilization.
<span class='pageno' title='629' id='Page_629'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>During Minister Severing’s time this co-operation worked without
friction with the idea of satisfying as far as possible the wishes
of the Reichswehr Minister, and it continued in the same way after
30 January 1933. The scope and content of the tasks remained the
same. When, on 4 April 1933, a Reich Defense Council was established
by a resolution of Hitler’s new Reich Government, the
committee was retained and only its name was changed: The Committee
of Experts became the Reich Defense Committee. However,
it did not change its field of action and was not given any new
jurisdiction. It only grew in size as it went on developing, especially
after the introduction of compulsory military service. Now, as
before, the Reich Defense Committee was a body which had to give
advice about those tasks of national defense concerning the civilian
sector which had to be prepared and also partly taken over by the
civil ministries. For this Count of the Indictment it must be made
quite clear that after 4 April 1933 Keitel’s position did not change
either, and especially that he was not a member of the Reich
Defense Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Defense Council, which has taken up a lot of space
in the statements of the Prosecution, may be considered as virtually
nonexistent in the light of the evidence produced—later on I will
come back to the time after 1938. In any case the Prosecution could
not prove that there was any session of the Reich Defense Council
during this period. The minutes submitted dealt without exception
with the sessions of the Reich Defense Committee, and the members
of this committee reported to their competent ministries, who in
turn had an opportunity, within the framework of the cabinet, to
translate into concrete form the suggestions and proposals discussed
in the Reich Defense Committee. Thus there were never any sessions
of the Reich Defense Council whose existence was merely
formal, so that witnesses could rightly say that the Reich Defense
Council existed only on paper.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel, up to 30 September 1933, as colonel and section chief in
the Reich Defense Ministry, and later from October 1935 as major
general and Chief of Staff of the Armed Forces Department in the
Reich War Ministry, was a member of the Reich Defense Committee.
Therefore, from 30 September 1933 to 30 September 1935 he was
not in the War Ministry, and thus had no function connected with
this Count of the Indictment. Neither did he during this time participate
in sessions of the Reich Defense Committee, the minutes of
which have been presented by the Prosecution as having special
probative value. The session of 22 May 1933, described as the
second session of the working Committee of Experts, was the last
session in which Keitel participated before being transferred to serve
with the troops. The first session after his transfer to the Reich
<span class='pageno' title='630' id='Page_630'></span>
War Ministry was held on 6 September 1935. It is put down as the
11th session of the Reich Defense Committee. Although in the examination
of Keitel’s responsibility one has to exclude the work done
by the Reich Defense Committee during the two years between
sessions 3 and 10, I will nevertheless make it the subject of my
statements, as it is from these very minutes that one can see what
the Reich Defense Committee was doing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Only the knowledge of these minutes makes it clear why an
institution, which in this or some other form exists in every country
and which serves the purpose of national defense as deemed legitimate
by every country, has now been presented as an important
factor in submitting evidence on plans and preparations for
aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The minutes of the sessions of the Reich Defense Committee in
1933, 1934, and 1935 reveal the character of the work as that of
preparations for the event of war. But it is likewise evident that it
is a question of preparations intended to bring about a more perfect
degree of readiness in national defense in case of mobilization. If
the “political situation” is twice mentioned, these allusions indicate
the fear of military sanctions from neighboring states. (Reference is
made to the case of Abyssinia, which led to sanctions against Italy.)
Everything is rooted in the thought of overcoming that state of
military impotency which made it impossible to safeguard the open
frontiers of the Reich.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The recurring idea of obligation to secrecy can only be attributed
to fear arising from the situation at the time lest the revelation of
measures, however defensive, might produce preventive measures
on the part of the victorious powers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That these suspicions were well-founded is shown by the
intransigent attitude of certain states after the complete disarmament
of Germany, and this question is important for Keitel’s
attitude, for he affirms that the conclusion drawn from the obligation
to secrecy, namely, that secrecy is a proof of bad conscience,
and bad conscience is a proof of knowledge of illegality, is
erroneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Reich Defense Committee never passed resolutions; it was
an advisory body on matters of national defense insofar as the
civilian sector was concerned with mobilization. At no time did it
ever indulge in deliberations concerning rearmament as regards
manpower or material, or concerning plans of aggression. The
Prosecution has tried in one instance to show that the Reich Defense
Committee was involved in plans for aggression.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I do not wish to read the next few sentences. Here we deal with
the well-known event of freeing the River Rhine for traffic, a
<span class='pageno' title='631' id='Page_631'></span>
question which was designated as the technical liberation of the
Rhine River. This came up in Göring’s testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>They pointed out Document Number EC-405, the minutes of the Committee for
Reich Defense, session of 26 June 1934, in which there is mention of “participation
in preparing mobilization.” In these minutes under (c) can be found: “Preparation
for the liberation of the Rhine.” From this the prosecuting authorities have drawn
the conclusion that already on 26 June 1934 the Reich Defense Committee was
contemplating the “liberation of the Rhine.” The witness Reich Marshal Göring has
stated during his hearing that, given the unequivocal wording of the German text,
it is a question here of the technical freeing of the river Rhine, but not of any
strategic or political matter. I am mentioning this manifest error by the prosecuting
authorities, which can only have occurred through a gross mistake in
translation, because it has led to an erroneous conception of the prosecution as
to the competence of the Reich Defense Committee, and because it is the only
case which has come up in connection with this complex.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>The true nature of the Reich Defense Committee’s activities is
set out quite simply and clearly in the <span class='it'>Manual of Mobilization for
the Civilian Administration</span>; Documents 1639-PS and 1639a-PS. It
refers to the result of discussions between all the experts of the
Reich Defense Committee, and is an appendix to the mobilization
plan of the Armed Forces as well as to that of armaments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>These three mobilization plans all taken together form the basis
of your decision. You may see from them whether the Prosecution
is right in its assumption of a total planning for aggressive war, or
whether the Defendant Keitel was right when he stated during his
hearing:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“What has been discussed and planned here is what every
country is entitled to do and what the responsible agencies
are bound to do, if they do not wish to violate their most
sacred duty, namely the safeguarding of the security of their
country.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The decision of 4 February 1938 was fateful for General Keitel
as well as for the German Wehrmacht: for Keitel who could not
yet form an opinion on the newly-created office of the “High Command
of the Armed Forces” (OKW) for the Armed Forces which on
that day lost its relative independence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler broke down the last barriers between himself and the
Armed Forces—the nation in arms—by removing both the Commander-in-Chief
of the Armed Forces and the constitutionally
responsible Reich War Minister. This truly portentous decision was
fatal for Keitel and the German nation, though at the time of its
occurrence this was not realized by the participants. That they
must be blamed for not realizing it is easy to say now, in retrospect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the time everybody who was not an inveterate skeptic or
pessimist had to base his judgment on the development of things
in general and on the strength of the personalities involved. Neither
the one nor the other could be clearly appreciated on 4 February
1938.
<span class='pageno' title='632' id='Page_632'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It was not a personal decision of the Defendant Keitel who did
not know Hitler personally in these days and who met him for the
first time man to man in the preliminary discussions. Hitler assigned
him to the newly-created office of Commander-in-Chief of the
Armed Forces and Keitel accepted it. Even if we disregard entirely
the human emotions connected with such a brilliant promotion there
was no reasonable ground for the then Chief of the Armed Forces
Department in the Reich War Ministry to decline the offer, since
Von Blomberg himself had recommended him. Hitler’s ideas about
this office could not be discerned by Keitel. I shall pass to the
next page...</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The decree gave Keitel a wonderfully impressive office name as “Chief of the
High Command of the Armed Forces.” The historical foundation is the elimination
of the commanding authority over the entire Armed Forces, which up to
4 February 1938 was in the hands of Field Marshal Von Blomberg, and on that
day was taken over by Hitler himself. Hitler created at the same time the
responsible Ministry of War, which up to that time had also been administrated
by Field Marshal Von Blomberg. Dr. Lammers says the following about the
origin of the Führer’s Decree of 4 February 1938: (Morning Session of 8 April 1946;
Volume XI, Page 29.)</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>The Führer informed me that the Reich Minister of War, Von Blomberg,
is resigning his office and that he avails himself of this opportunity to
make some other changes in the Reich Government, particularly since
the Foreign Minister, Von Neurath, is going to retire, which will make
a change; there is also a change in the High Command of the Army. In
this connection the Führer gave orders for a decree to be worked out
regarding the Command of the Armed Forces. It was to be merged with
the Ministry of War. As a directive the Führer gave me the following
instruction:</span></p>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>In the future I shall not have any War Minister; neither will I have in the
future a Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces to stand between me,
as the Supreme Commander, and the other commanders-in-chief within
the Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>In accordance with this instruction the decree was formulated, by which
the High Command of the Armed Forces was established as an Army
Staff directly subordinate to the command of the Führer. The Führer
did not want any independent office in this function, inserted between
himself and the commanders-in-chief of the Armed Forces branches. In
consequence, General Keitel, now appointed Chief of the High Command
of the Armed Forces, had no independent commanding authority over the
different branches of the Armed Forces. Such authority would not have
been considered for other reasons as well.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Field Marshal Von Blomberg declares in the affidavit I have submitted: To
Question 24:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>At our last discussion Hitler pointed out that he presumably would not
fill my position again, and that he would thereby become himself the real
Supreme Commander of the German Army</span>...</p>

<p>“He asked for a suggestion for the assignment of a <span class='it'>Chef du
Bureau</span> who would direct and carry out current tasks under
him and thus under Hitler’s responsibility.</p>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>I named Keitel, who, under me, had administered this office very capably.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>In answer to Question 27:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“I proposed Keitel as <span class='it'>Chef du Bureau</span>, believing that I had
put him in the right job.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='633' id='Page_633'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In such a position he would not be a military adviser to Hitler. Whether and
in how far Hitler ever asked for his advice, I do not know. Even so, Keitel’s
responsibility, in my opinion, would not thereby be established.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>Question 29:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Was it not Hitler’s intention to create a tool for himself in
the person of Keitel, whose capacity for organization and
hard work seemed to him valuable, as an executive organ for
his decisions and orders?</p>

<p>“Answer: This question is emphatically confirmed by me.
Hitler’s original intention at that time was most certainly to
have at his disposal a trustworthy subordinate organ, and in
no way an adviser endowed with any responsibility.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>The decree of 4 February 1938 regarding leadership in the Armed
Forces is known to the Tribunal. Therefore, I do not need to read
it to you. One sees from this and from the hearing of witnesses
regarding the position of the Defendant Keitel and questions of his
competence and responsibility, that:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Hitler did not want either a responsible War Ministry or any
other person but himself to exercise the commanding authority over
the entire Armed Forces. He united in his own person both these
institutions by declaring that, in regard to the commanding authority,
he would from now on exercise this directly and personally, as
well as the functions of the Reich War Ministry which were to be
administered by Keitel under his instructions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Hitler thus created a military staff for a military-technical
program. He designated it the High Command of the Armed Forces.
This “Oberkommando der Wehrmacht” was therefore nothing
more—and, I may add, no less—than the military chancellery of the
Führer and Supreme Commander. Such chancelleries already existed
as Reich Chancellery, Presidential Chancellery, and Party Chancellery.
The Defendant Keitel was assigned to the post of chief of
the military chancellery with the title of Chief of Staff of the High
Command of the Armed Forces (for short, Chief OKW).</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Hence it follows that the OKW was not intended to be an
intermediary agency between the Supreme Commander of the
Armed Forces and the three Armed Forces’ sections. The assumption
to the contrary held by the Prosecution, which is based on a
graphic representation, is founded upon an erroneous opinion.</p>

<p class='pindent'>An independent intermediary level between the Supreme Commander
and the three Commanders-in-Chief of the Army, Navy,
and Air Force such as existed before 4 February 1938 no longer
existed. The OKW, in which the Defendant Keitel was the Chief of
Staff, was no independent military agency or authority, but exclusively
Hitler’s military-technical staff and his War Ministry office.
The OKW had no independent authority whatsoever, neither the
<span class='pageno' title='634' id='Page_634'></span>
power to issue orders nor the command authority. Therefore, the
OKW could not issue its own orders. On the contrary, all instructions,
decrees, general directions, or orders issued by the OKW
were the expression of the desires of the Supreme Commander of
the Armed Forces. The Commanders-in-Chief of the three Armed
Forces’ branches were always aware of the fact that no intermediary
level existed between them and the Supreme Commander, and
they never considered or recognized the OKW as such. This is confirmed
by the affidavits of the Codefendants Admiral Dönitz and
Admiral Raeder, as well as by the testimony of Reich Marshal
Göring and Dr. Lammers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The idea that the OKW, or the Defendant Keitel as Chief of the
OKW, would have had authority to issue instructions or orders
independently is therefore erroneous. All official business, oral or
in writing, which went beyond an exchange of ideas with other
military agencies or authorities, was subject to the exclusive
decision of the Supreme Commander himself. The OKW was merely
the executive staff of the Supreme Commander.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Therefore, when documents issued by the Supreme Commander
or by the OKW show signatures or initials of the Defendant
Keitel, or of a chief of office or section chief, one must not draw
the conclusion that the persons concerned had authority to issue
orders independently. In each instance it was merely a case of
noting, forwarding, or transmitting the orders of the Supreme Commander
himself. Because of the demands made on Hitler’s time in
his positions as head of State, Reich Chancellor, Party Leader, and
Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, it was not always
possible to obtain his personal signature, unless it concerned fundamental
matters of unusual significance. It must be noted that in
all cases Hitler’s personal decision or approval had to be obtained.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Such being the state of affairs, we cannot accept the Prosecution’s
argument that because the Defendant Keitel signed or initialed
documents he is co-responsible for their actual contents. It would
be arbitrary to infer the responsibility of the Defendant Keitel as
chief of the military chancellery because he forwarded or signed
orders, instructions, and so on, a responsibility which in my opinion
can be charged only to the person who promulgates the order by
virtue of his authority.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A real responsibility for this could be laid upon the Defendant
Keitel only in case it were proved that he willfully participated in
drawing up these orders, instructions, et cetera.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, would that be a convenient time
to break off?</p>

<h3>[<span class='it'>A recess was taken.</span>]</h3>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='635' id='Page_635'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>M. CHARLES DUBOST (Deputy Chief Prosecutor for the French
Republic): Gentlemen, Counsel for the Defense have presented a
request to the French Prosecution to have certain documents communicated
to them. This request is divided into two parts.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The first part concerns the Scapini incident, which arose from
the publication of a document in the course of my own statement.
I am able to communicate to the Defense the answer which the
French Government has made to its request.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The French Government has found in the archives left behind
by the German authorities the answer which was made to the
protest raised at the time of the massacre of French prisoners. It is,
by the way, a purely dilatory answer. The German authorities
replied that the Armistice Commission was not competent; that the
request must be made by the Scapini Embassy. I have handed this
document to the Defense and I think that the incident is closed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The second part of defense counsel’s request concerns a statement
made by my colleague, M. Edgar Faure, who at the beginning
of his speech announced to the Tribunal that he had examined
approximately 2,500 documents, of which he had retained only 200.
I can, of course, not answer on behalf of M. Edgar Faure. I only
know that the French Delegation has only a total of 800 documents
in its archives, and has submitted them all to the Tribunal and to
the Defense. I therefore think that it is merely oratorical hyperbole
and that my colleague wished to allude to covering letters which
were of no importance. In any case, I had previously informed
defense counsel Dr. Nelte that all the documents of our delegation
were open for him to see and that he would be able to verify that
we had no other documents than those which we had published.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On the other hand, the requests which we forwarded to Paris
to have complementary documents which might have been forgotten
sent to us have all been in vain. We therefore conclude that we have
here all the documents which we could make use of in this Trial.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Mr. President, I am grateful to the French Delegation
for the explanation given now regarding the complaint I made
this morning. If I had had that explanation a few days earlier, what
happened this morning would not have occurred. I regret it very
much indeed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I continue on Page 64 to the effect that Keitel co-operated in
drawing up orders. In order to clarify this as much as possible I
would like furthermore to point out the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>The “instructions,” which were of fundamental significance for
the planning of military operations, are operational orders issued to
the Commanders-in-Chief of the three Armed Forces’ branches by
the Supreme Commander in this capacity. Before these instructions
<span class='pageno' title='636' id='Page_636'></span>
were drawn up Hitler discussed the military-technical aspect of each
order with the competent OKW experts and also with the Defendant
Keitel. The instructions, aside from opinions manifested by the
individual experts, were exclusively the expression of the Supreme
Commander’s wishes, and they were not directed to the OKW but
to the Commanders-in-Chief of the three Armed Forces’ branches, to
whom they were forwarded through the OKW. The three Armed
Forces’ branches on their part ordered, on the basis of the general
instructions, the details incident to their execution. Therefore, I
shall not refer in this connection to the statement of the Charter
according to which the carrying-out of orders is not accepted as a
ground for exemption from punishment. For the transmission of
the order was not an order issued by the OKW to the Armed
Forces’ branches, but the forwarding of the expression of the wishes
of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. The order
directed to the OKW, if you will, referred in all cases to the elaboration
of some desire expressed by the Supreme Commander and
to the purely external act of transmitting the finished idea without
having authority of expressing an opinion thereon. It must be
assumed that the Prosecution, perhaps influenced by the defendant’s
rank of Field Marshal, did not appreciate correctly this position
of the Defendant Keitel. This rank had no relationship to the real
authority of the defendant to issue military orders. One is inclined
to imagine that a Field Marshal is a military commander. However,
as we have seen, the Defendant Keitel had no command authority
whatsoever.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Field Marshal Von Blomberg, whose testimony has been submitted
to the Tribunal by the Prosecution, defines the position of
the Defendant Keitel as <span class='it'>Chef du Bureau</span>. This definition is materially
correct. A <span class='it'>Chef du Bureau</span> has to see to it that the bureau
which he directs operates properly; that the affairs are correctly
and promptly attended to by the competent officials. But he does
not participate in the final decisions deemed correct by his superior,
in this case the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. If this
principle holds true in general, it is especially true here. It is
known that Hitler did not accept any advice from Keitel concerning
military decisions. This has been proved by the evidence, particularly
by the testimony of General Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Defendant Keitel has clearly outlined in Affidavit Number 8,
called “Coordination in the State and in the Armed Forces,” his
activity and that of the OKW. The affidavit gives an idea of the
difficult and thankless work of the Defendant Keitel. It consisted
mainly of a co-ordination of the desires and needs of the Armed
Forces’ branches. It consisted, furthermore, in reconciling, divergencies
as they arose and in the struggle against Hitler’s negative
<span class='pageno' title='637' id='Page_637'></span>
attitude toward any proper procedure, that is to say, through the
competent departments.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In every branch of the Armed Forces there exist interests which
differ from the interests of other branches and which cannot be
entirely satisfied; sometimes they even oppose each other. This is
true especially for the replacement of personnel, but also for the
supply of everything that is required for special warfare.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The point of intersection of all these factual and personal differences
of opinion was the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If one desires to estimate properly the incontestable fact that the
Defendant Keitel was shown hostility and was personally judged
unfavorably by nearly all sides, one must note that this fact occurred
as a necessary result of the overlapping of factually opposing interests
and personal differences of opinion, which Keitel tried to settle
by means of co-ordination or mediation, that is, in nearly all cases
by means of compromise. No particular personal experience is
needed in order to know that the objective mediator will always
incur the ingratitude of both parties. The same picture becomes
evident in the relationship to the numerous offices which were
endowed with special official authorities or which had Hitler’s favor
and special confidence for personal, mostly Party political, reasons.
One must realize these differences and overlapping interests to
appreciate the heavy burden involved in Keitel’s position and, I
might add, in order to judge correctly the significance of his position.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is difficult to realize the special relationship between the
leadership of the Armed Forces and the political sector because the
functions of Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces, of Reich
War Minister and of head of State were from 4 February 1938 all
embodied in the person of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Therefore, since 4 February 1938, complete accord existed
between the political leadership and the highest leadership of the
Armed Forces since both powers resided in one and the same person.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The assumption of the Prosecution that the chief of Hitler’s
military staff was closely connected with his superior Hitler and
must therefore also be held responsible for political questions, if
not as the perpetrator, then in some form as provided in Article 6
of the Charter, is erroneous.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection there is no need to enter into the hierarchy
of the Führer State and the binding character of the Führer order.
The military hierarchy is older than the National Socialist ideology;
moreover it must be stated and taken into consideration that
the introduction of the absolute Leadership Principle into the Armed
Forces signifies the final elimination of all efforts which could
perhaps be regarded as democratic in a certain sense, or in any case
<span class='pageno' title='638' id='Page_638'></span>
as a restraint on the dictatorial appetite of Hitler. In this connection
I refer to the affidavit of Keitel, Document Book 2, Number 9,
“The OKW and the General Staff.” The rigid application of the
Leadership Principle, judged retrospectively, gradually adulterated
the healthy military principle of obedience into immoderate militarism.
This found its expression, among other things, in the prohibition
of all criticism, from the highest authorities to the lowest.
I refer you to the speech made, by Hitler in the Kroll Opera House
in 1937 or 1936, also to the critical marginal note—statement of
General Winter—in the decree prohibiting applications for release
on the part of the generals in 1938, and finally to the removal of
the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces and the War
Minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot and shall not be denied that the Defendant Keitel was
absolutely in favor of the Leadership Principle in the leadership
of the Armed Forces and that the essay “Foundations of the Organization
of the German Armed Forces” (L-211) can be regarded as a
contribution to the conduct of a future war—not, however, that an
actual war was anticipated at that time or that it was the reason
for this essay.</p>

<p class='pindent'>What does this mean in regard to the Defendant Keitel? Anyone
recognizing the Leadership Principle as being militarily correct
must act accordingly. Professor Jahrreiss has stated that the
Leadership Principle, like every other political system, is not absolutely
good or bad, but that everything depends on the manner and
methods used in applying it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel has a military background and favors the Leadership
Principle for the field he knows. According to this principle the
responsibility lies completely with the one who has authority to
command. While the Leadership Principle in fact hardly underwent
any change in the civilian areas where it was also applied,
though superficially, this principle necessarily made itself felt much
more strongly in the military sphere, particularly in the relationship
between the commanders-in-chief and their chiefs of the General
Staff.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Formerly the chiefs of the General Staff had been the really
responsible commanders, now they became the operational assistants
to the commanders-in-chief. In the formulation of orders they were
“collaborating advisers” in the field of strategic operations, for which
these officers had been especially trained. Keitel was neither a
commander-in-chief nor a chief of the General Staff; he was the
chief of the military chancellery under Hitler, a soldier and an
administrator of war-ministerial duties, therefore a “minister,”
claims the Prosecution.
<span class='pageno' title='639' id='Page_639'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>One should not refer in this Trial to formal distinctions when
the real functions give another picture. This is particularly important
in the case of Keitel. It should be determined what he actually
was and how he acted in reality.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The dual position created by the decree of 4 February 1938 has
led to an erroneous conception of Keitel’s functions. We assume
that Hitler dissolved the Reich War Ministry because he no longer
wished to have a War Minister; in spite of the fact that on
4 February 1938 a considerable number of functions up to then
handled by the Reich War Ministry had been assigned to the individual
Armed Forces’ branches, there were a number of functions
which had to be retained and administered in the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>But taking into account the idea of an intended strict concentration
of functions pertaining to the conduct of the war, Keitel was
unable to deal even with those on the basis of complete authority
and according to his own judgment, but had to present the
demands of the Armed Forces and co-ordinate the Armed Forces’
affairs with the tasks of the other ministries.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It cannot and will not be denied that this concentration of duties
in the person of Hitler was impracticable. Thus, a huge amount of
preparatory and executive work rested with Hitler’s military staff,
whose Chief of Staff was Keitel. Hence, it was also responsible,
although not with reference to important questions, especially those
of a fundamental nature. It was, of course, a matter of judgment
to what extent the Defendant Keitel considered matters essential
and fundamental and submitted them. But the evidence showed
that when in doubt about matters, after conscientious examination,
Keitel was inclined to present them rather than to make his own
decision about them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The sources from which Hitler obtained his news, through
Himmler, Bormann or some other way, were so intricate that Keitel
had no way of knowing whether Hitler had the information that
seemed to him to be important. To avoid the unavoidable discussions
afterward with Hitler who, being distrustful of everyone,
always took it for granted that people would intentionally conceal
things from him, Keitel was anxious not to leave himself open to
the reproach of having omitted anything. A characteristic example
is the case of the mass escape of 80 R. A. F. officers from the POW
Camp Sagan.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Here the point is simply to show that Keitel in his capacity as
guardian of the actual war functions which still remained in the
OKW, held no position as a minister. Here, too, he was the <span class='it'>Chef
du Bureau</span>, the head of the military chancellery, a position which is
also held by the chief of a ministerial office, or even a state secretary.
I wish to refer again in this connection to Dr. Lammers’
<span class='pageno' title='640' id='Page_640'></span>
statement, and to the affidavits of Admirals Raeder and Dönitz,
which I have already mentioned repeatedly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The text of the Führer decree of 4 February 1938 shows that
Hitler also wished to make this clear. If Hitler had not had the
definite desire to exclude everyone else from a responsible, and
perhaps for him uncomfortable function in the highest military
sector, he might have given Keitel at least the authority to take
part in Cabinet meetings. In the Führer decree in which the Commanders-in-Chief
of the Army and Navy as well as Keitel had been
given the “rank” of a Reich minister, it was explicitly ordered that
both commanders-in-chief should be entitled to take part in Cabinet
meetings. The fact that this was decreed simultaneously is a convincing
<span class='it'>argumentum e contrario</span>. It proves that Hitler did not wish
to give his Chief of Staff of the OKW an opportunity to present
his own opinions and possible doubts before the Cabinet. Hitler
gave the Defendant Keitel the “rank” of a Reich minister for the
purpose of enabling him to carry on direct negotiations with the
departmental ministers. Had Keitel not had the rank of a Reich
minister, he would have been limited to conferences with state
secretaries and the like, and thus be very much handicapped in
carrying out the Führer’s orders and his tasks.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is in error, therefore, that the Prosecution has classified
Keitel as a Reich minister “without portfolio.” He was not a
minister, nor a member of the Reich Government. State Secretary
Stuckart in a document submitted to the Prosecution has listed all
members of the Reichsregierung. Keitel is not among them; he is
mentioned in this document only as the holder of one of the highest
offices.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, the Prosecution has not limited the term Reichsregierung
to membership in the Reich Cabinet, but considered other committees
as part of the Reichsregierung, too. It would seem, therefore,
as if the Prosecution looked upon the legal structure based on
German law as irrelevant. Pursuant to Appendix B to the general
bill of Indictment, the Reichsregierung in the sense of the Indictment
is composed of:</p>

<p class='pindent'>1. Members of the regular Cabinet after 30 January 1933, the
day Hitler became Chancellor of the German Republic. The
expression “regular Cabinet” used here includes: Reich ministers,
that is, heads of departments of the Central Government; Reich
ministers without portfolio, ministers of State with the function
of Reich ministers, and other officials entitled to participate in the
Cabinet meetings.</p>

<p class='pindent'>2. Members of the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the
Reich.
<span class='pageno' title='641' id='Page_641'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>3. Members of the Secret Cabinet Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Regardless of the individual responsibility of every defendant
the Tribunal must examine whether the concept of a “Reich Government”
as defined by the Prosecution is correct, that is, practical;
whether, as to the composition of this group, the Prosecution’s
concept of a “Reich Government” appears justified. In any case it
is not sufficient to accept as correct the assertion of the Prosecution
in this respect.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I assume that my colleague Dr. Kubuschok will enlarge on this
during his case.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, the Tribunal feels that you are
taking a very long time over this question of whether Keitel was—what
his exact position was.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I believe, Mr. President, that the Prosecution also
took a great deal of time to make clear what position Field Marshal
Keitel occupied in their opinion. He is not here as Field Marshal,
but as the Chief of the OKW.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Well, if they have, I must confess that I
have forgotten. It seems to me and the Tribunal generally that you
are taking up far too long on this topic. You have got many other
topics which are of very great importance to the defendant, and
you have already been speaking for several hours, and you occupied
a large number of pages in order to try and define what Keitel’s
position was. I thought you might be able to cut it down.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: I shall try.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I have explained that Defendant Keitel did not belong to
Group 1; that is to say, that he was not a minister.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>He was neither chief of a Government department, nor a Reich minister
without portfolio, nor a state minister having the functions of a Reich minister,
nor an official who was entitled to attend Cabinet sessions.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In the hearing of evidence it was proved that despite the Führer
Decree of 4 February 1938 there never existed a Secret Cabinet
Council; that such council was never set up; that it never held a
session; and that no persons involved ever received a commission.
Thus, it is proved that the defendant was also never a member of
the Secret Cabinet Council.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is true that Keitel was a member of the Ministerial Council
for the Defense of the Reich. Witness Dr. Lammers has confirmed
that the fact of his becoming a member of the Ministerial Council
for the Defense of the Reich did not change Keitel’s official position,
and especially did not make him a minister. In his affidavit of
25 November 1945, Codefendant Dr. Frick says that Keitel worked
in the Ministerial Council for the Defense of the Reich as “liaison
man.”
<span class='pageno' title='642' id='Page_642'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Although he is not listed among the members of the Reich Cabinet, Keitel’s
capacities as a member of the so-called “Dreimänner-Kollegium” (Three Man
College) and as a member of the Reich Defense Council have been mentioned
by the Prosecution. I believe I may refer to the result of the hearing of evidence.
It was shown that a Three Man College as a Government committee never existed,
and that the Reich Defense Council, after the unpublished Reich Defense Law of
1938, never held sessions, or in any case that it never held conferences, or passed
resolutions.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to clarify the Defendant Keitel’s responsibility and
competence it is necessary to analyze the concept of OKW. I ask
that this statement be not considered a theoretical and therefore
superfluous discussion. The very fact that the Prosecution makes a
sweeping and fundamental assertion...</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, may I ask what you have been
doing if you have not been analyzing the concept of the OKW?</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: Up to now I have explained Keitel’s position as
Chief of the OKW. In statements on Page 74 and the following
pages I wanted to explain to you that the Prosecution, and others
as well, have talked about the OKW: and “OKW” is a word which
has three different types of significance.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, if you will be good enough to permit me to submit
this in its written form, and if you would consider it as having
been presented in Court, then I am willing to leave out the pages
up to 77 and submit them to you. In any case, it appears to me to
be an important part of the explanation regarding the interpretation
of the word “OKW,” and the fact that this is not identical with
Keitel is particularly important.</p>

<p class='pindent'>May I do that?</p>

<p class='pindent'>[<span class='it'>The President nodded his assent.</span>]</p>

<p class='pindent'>In that case, then, I shall continue at Page 77.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In order to clarify the Defendant Keitel’s responsibility and competence it is
necessary to analyze the concept of OKW. I ask that this statement be not
considered a theoretical and therefore superfluous discussion. The very fact that
the Prosecution makes a sweeping and fundamental assertion, and that the French
Prosecution undertakes a pointedly legal examination of the question as to the
office in which each defendant was active with regard to the counts he is charged
with, makes it my duty to clear up a mistake made by the Prosecution. However,
this mistake is all the more excusable, because not only foreign countries but
large groups at home, even within the Armed Forces, did not know what OKW
meant. It became a popular collective term for the supreme command of the
Armed Forces without anybody taking the trouble to find out who and what was
behind the three words “Oberkommando der Wehrmacht.” This corresponds to the
law of inertia governing the association of human beings, to the almost pathological
mania to abbreviate titles of military commands. Since, furthermore, the communiqués
of the High Command of the Armed Forces were published daily, and
all announcements referring to war events began with the words: “The High
Command of the Armed Forces announces,” not only did these words become
impressed upon the public’s mind, but also the conception that the “High
Command of the Armed Forces” was the supreme military command. The conception
would be correct had the words OKW not been translated with Oberkommando
der Wehrmacht (High Command of the Armed Forces) but rather as
Supreme Commander (Oberkommandierender) of the Armed Forces. It was
Hitler alone, as “Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces,” who was the</span>
<span class='pageno' title='643' id='Page_643'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>incarnation of what everybody imagined the OKW to be, namely, the central
military planning and command headquarters and thus the supreme command
and executive headquarters for all military matters. In this respect the OKW
was synonymous with Hitler as “Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces,”
which was his official title.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>If, in naming the headquarters of the supreme commander, it was desired to
avoid the title “Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces” which was in accordance
with the prevalent Leadership Principle, the title “Oberkommando der Wehrmacht”
was bound to be used. This headquarters comprises the supreme
commander himself, that is, Hitler, and his assistants, his staff.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The Führer Decree of 4 February 1938 bearing the heading: “Decree concerning
the Command of the Armed Forces” resulted, through the unfortunate
and vague nature of its wording, in an interpretation that the “Chief OKW”
mentioned therein was the chief in the sense of director, of the High Command
of the Armed Forces. It is true that it follows from the decree that “Chief OKW”
is to mean “Chief of Staff OKW,” that is chief of Hitler’s bureau in his capacity
as Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. But since then, every time that
people have spoken and speak of the OKW, everybody thinks of Keitel without
examining whether the expression means: OKW-Oberkommandierender (Supreme
Commander) of the Armed Forces, OKW-Headquarters of the Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces, or OKW-Staff of the Headquarters of the Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The Prosecution makes no distinction in this respect, just as the German
agencies were unaware of the exact difference, or at any rate paid no attention
to it. They, just like the Prosecution now, thought it right to claim the OKW’s
jurisdiction and responsibility for anything having a connection with the Armed
Forces or members of the Armed Forces. From this viewpoint to claiming Keitel’s
personal jurisdiction by virtue of the title “Chief OKW” there is only a short step.
For Germans and foreigners the recollection of the first World War was a contributing
factor in forming this opinion, which was not based on an examination
according to constitutional law. The relationship between Hitler and Keitel
prompted the comparison with the relationship between the Kaiser and Von Hindenburg.
This comparison had results for the Defendant Keitel which are shown
at this Trial. Without thinking of the fundamental differences between Von Hindenburg
as Chief of the Great General Staff which existed until 1918, and Keitel
as the chief of Hitler’s military executive staff, and without knowing the field of
Keitel’s jurisdiction and what possibilities Keitel had as regards Hitler’s plans
and measures by virtue of the functions assigned to him, comparisons were made
which gave rise to doubts about him. When furthermore—after the catastrophe
had set in—Keitel once again came to play an outwardly similar part as representative
of the Armed Forces when he had to execute the signature for unconditional
surrender, this comparison also turned out to his disadvantage. People do not
ask about jurisdiction when things go badly, but look for a guilty person and the
guilty person is judged by external appearances. Quite naturally the great
attention paid to Keitel’s person at this Trial can largely be traced to the fact
that after Hitler’s death Keitel came into the public eye.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to see clearly what part Keitel really played, and what
share he had in what happened, I now wish—after investigating
his legal competencies—to examine what actual influence he had
upon the development and carrying-out of the measures, the effects
of which constitute the subject of this Trial. From everyday
experience we know that it does not matter so much what a person
is supposed to be in a particular position, but what he has made
of that position by virtue of his personality. I believe I may say
that in the course of this Trial the personality of no other defendant
has been judged in such varying and contradictory ways as that
of the Defendant Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Decisive for Keitel’s material responsibility is his actual position
in the tug-of-war with and around Hitler, his effective influence
<span class='pageno' title='644' id='Page_644'></span>
upon that group, and thus on those circumstances as a whole which
could have influenced the operations of Hitler’s headquarters in the
military field.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall deal with this fundamental topic when taking up the
charges made by the Prosecution against Keitel and other defendants
on the strength of the cross-examination of Dr. Gisevius, in
other words, after the presentation of evidence for Keitel has been
completed.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In view of the comprehensive scope of Justice Jackson’s questions
and the answers given thereto by Dr. Gisevius, the testimony
of Dr. Gisevius has become of tremendous importance in the case
of the Defendant Keitel. Had Dr. Gisevius’ statements about Keitel
been true—that is, statements made by him on the basis of information,
in most instances in terms of conclusive findings—the
Defendant Keitel could not have told the truth during the presentation
of evidence. The importance of that fact becomes evident
when it is considered that a negative opinion on truthfulness would
of necessity destroy Keitel’s defense, which in its essence draws on
the subjective aspect of facts as a whole. In view of this fact and
the importance of the testimony of Dr. Gisevius also for other
defendants, it becomes my duty to explain the contrast between
Keitel’s answers and the testimony of the witness Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Experience teaches us that dead witnesses are the best witnesses,
because their purported utterances cannot be directly refuted.
Evidence on the strength of information belongs to another group
of statements which almost defy refutation. The testimony of
Gisevius combines both possibilities, in that he bases his testimony
primarily on information obtained from witnesses who are dead.
Justice Jackson used Dr. Gisevius as star witness in his comprehensive
attack on the Defendant Keitel. After the completion
of the presentation of evidence against Keitel, he did not bring
forward one individual circumstance, but an Indictment on all
Counts and a general judgment, on Keitel’s answers.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The counterevidence is concerned with proving the objective
incorrectness of facts based upon information obtained from certain
individuals and further, with establishing proof of the unreliability
of the information. I call to mind the words which the Defendant
Keitel said under oath upon completion of his direct examination
by me while in the witness box:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“One may hold it against me that I was wrong and made
mistakes, that my attitude toward the Führer Adolf Hitler
was wrong and weak, but it should not be said of me that I
was a coward, that I was untruthful, and that I was disloyal.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='645' id='Page_645'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I sum up in condensed form the charges made against the
Defendant Keitel during interrogation by the Prosecution, as
follows:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) Keitel built an impenetrable ring round Hitler so that the
latter could be told nothing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) Keitel failed to pass on to Hitler reports he had received
from Canaris whenever they concerned atrocities, crimes, and the
like, or he gave orders to modify them.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) Keitel had a tremendous influence on the OKW and the Army.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) Keitel threatened his subordinates, when they made political
statements, that he would not protect them; he even said that he
would turn them over to the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Gisevius says in one part of his statement that Keitel had no
influence over Hitler. He exonerates Hitler by explaining that
Keitel had formed a ring round Hitler, in order that the latter should
be told nothing. The British and American Prosecution in their
Indictment called Keitel a powerful staff officer who had exerted
great influence over Hitler; the French Prosecution described Keitel
as a willing tool of Hitler; the German generals called him a “yes
man” who could not carry anything through; and now Keitel grows,
according to the statement of Dr. Gisevius, into a real handyman
and buffer for Hitler, who hid from the latter anything bad, who
submitted to him only what he saw fit, and permitted no one to
approach Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To assert that Keitel blocked access to Hitler, can only be maintained
by somebody who did not know the conditions prevailing
around Hitler. Before the war Keitel worked in Berlin in Bendler
Strasse, while Hitler was in Wilhelmstrasse. Keitel came perhaps
once a week to report, or on special order. At that time, on account
of the distance, it was in fact impossible for Keitel to exert any
influence over access to the Führer. It was equally impossible when
Hitler was at the Berghof near Berchtesgaden for weeks at a time,
while Keitel remained in Berlin.</p>

<p class='pindent'>At the beginning of operations, Keitel was with Jodl and the
Armed Forces Operations Staff at the Führer’s headquarters. Here
also they were separated. Keitel did not sit in Hitler’s anteroom,
but rather in other buildings or barracks. He came from time to
time with General Jodl to the conference on the situation, in which,
besides Hitler, some 15 or 20 officers of all three branches of the
Armed Forces took part. Apart from the conferences on the situation
there was no personal contact. When Hitler wanted Keitel
for anything he sent for him. Personally and individually there was
closer contact in Berlin between Hitler and his adjutants, the Chief
of the Party Chancellery, the Chief of the Presidential Chancellery,
<span class='pageno' title='646' id='Page_646'></span>
and the Chief of the Reich Chancellery. Keitel not only could not
decide who should see Hitler, he also could not possibly prevent
anybody going to Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Hitler’s sources of information were the responsible heads of
each department; it was occasionally not clear whence Hitler obtained
his information, as I have already stated. Gisevius did not
know these conditions from his own experience; he himself was
never near Keitel, who never saw or spoke to him and did not know
his name. When he gave his opinion here, he could only base it on
information given him by Canaris, Thomas, and Oster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>General Jodl has been heard regarding this question. He
certainly is the best witness in this matter, since he, as well as
Keitel, lived in direct proximity to Hitler and therefore could
form his own judgment. He stated concerning this matter:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“Unfortunately, it was impossible to keep things from Hitler.
Many channels of information led directly to Hitler.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Upon my interrogation, at the suggestion of the Tribunal, Jodl
fully confirmed that what Keitel had testified was quite correct, and
that what witness Gisevius stated in this respect was, in general,
merely figures of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Codefendants, Admirals Raeder and Dönitz, have confirmed
that the allegation of the witness Gisevius that Keitel was able to
keep the commanders-in-chief of the branches of the Armed Forces
away from Hitler is false. If, however, this was not the case, it
follows that the way from the branches of the Armed Forces to
the Führer was open at any time. Through the hearing of witnesses
it was also established that apart from Jodl, the Chief of the Armed
Forces Operations Staff, Canaris in particular had direct access to
Hitler. Thus, the accusation of the witness Gisevius that Keitel
had formed a ring round Hitler is proved false.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness Gisevius has declared that reports were submitted
to Keitel by Canaris about atrocities in connection with deportations,
extermination of Jews, concentration camps, the persecution of the
Church, and the killing of insane persons, all of which Keitel withheld
from Hitler. The same is alleged about the reports of General
Thomas, Chief of the War Economy Office, the purpose of which
was to inform Hitler about the war potential of the enemy and
make him listen to reason.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Concerning Admiral Canaris’ reports, it must be said that as
chief of espionage and counterintelligence he naturally delivered
regular reports which concerned the conduct of the war, including
the conduct of economic warfare. It is affirmed that reports were
submitted on subjects which belonged neither to the jurisdiction
of the Counterintelligence Office nor to that of the OKW. It has
<span class='pageno' title='647' id='Page_647'></span>
been proved that Hitler took strict care that every worker confined
himself to his own special field, and it was particularly forbidden
for military offices to concern themselves with political affairs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel has declared under oath that he knew nothing about the
atrocities, and especially the extermination of the Jews and the
concentration camps. This is in absolute contradiction to the assertion
of the witness Gisevius that Canaris submitted reports to the
Defendant Keitel on the above-mentioned subjects.</p>

<p class='pindent'>One can assert that reports of any kind whatsoever were
delivered to Keitel without fear of being contradicted, especially
when one has no fear that these reports will be found. For if they
are not delivered they cannot be found, because they do not exist.
Now Gisevius has declared that he collected documents from the
beginning which contained incriminating material. Is it not remarkable,
under these circumstances, that up to now none of these
reports have been produced? As far as they were available at the
OKW, they have been used in the accusation and as evidence. Can
it be sufficient under these circumstances for a witness to declare
that he knows from third parties that such reports were submitted
to Keitel?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Canaris, because of his particular activity, which took him constantly
to foreign countries on personal secret errands for Hitler,
had access to Hitler at all times. He would thus have had an
opportunity to go to Hitler immediately if he had had such serious
misgivings of conscience, as Gisevius has declared he had. Why did
he not do so?</p>

<p class='pindent'>Now, Gisevius, who in general has pronounced comprehensive
and damning accusations, has, luckily for Keitel, at one point of his
deposition made a positive declaration that permits of objective
verification. I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...I believe that I have still two examples to mention, which
to me are particularly characteristic: First, the attempt was
made by all possible means to induce Field Marshal Keitel to
warn Hitler against the invasion of Holland and Belgium,
that is, to inform Hitler that the information submitted by
Keitel about alleged violations of neutrality by the Dutch and
Belgians was false. The Counterintelligence Office was to
prepare reports incriminating the Dutch and Belgians.
Admiral Canaris at that time refused to sign these reports.
I request that this be verified. He told Keitel repeatedly that
this report which was ostensibly made by the OKW was false.
This is an instance where Herr Keitel did not transmit to
Hitler what he was supposed to have transmitted...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span class='pageno' title='648' id='Page_648'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I have submitted to General Jodl, here on the witness stand,
Document 790-PS, which refers to the case of the <span class='it'>White Paper</span> concerning
violations of neutrality by Holland and Belgium. Jodl
testified literally, and I quote:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“...I understand the question, and would like very briefly to
state the facts how it was possible—if disgust does not choke
me. I was present when Canaris came to the Field Marshal
in the Reich Chancellery with these report notes and laid
before him the draft of the Foreign Office’s <span class='it'>White Paper</span>.
Field Marshal Keitel then looked it through, above all paying
attention to the comments which Canaris had made at the
request of the Foreign Office, namely, that the reports were
perhaps still somewhat in need of improvement, that he
should confirm the fact that a military operation against
Holland and Belgium was absolutely necessary, and that, as
is expressed here, a final really striking violation of neutrality
was still lacking. Before Canaris had said a word, Field
Marshal Keitel threw the book on the table and said: ‘I refuse
to do this, why should I take any responsibility at all for a
political decision? In this <span class='it'>White Paper</span> there appear word for
word, true and correct, the very same reports that you, yourself,
Canaris, brought to me.’ To this Canaris said: I am
entirely of the same point of view. It is, in my opinion too,
entirely superfluous to have this document signed on the part
of the Armed Forces, and the reports that we have here are
altogether quite sufficient to prove the violations of neutrality
which have taken place in Holland and Belgium.’ And he
advised Field Marshal Keitel not to sign it at all. That is the
way it happened. The Field Marshal then took the paper with
him and I do not know what happened subsequently...”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel did not sign the <span class='it'>White Paper</span>. Therefore in the only
verifiable case a clear proof is obtained of the incorrectness of
Gisevius’ testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>According to the statement of the witness Gisevius, Keitel
exerted a tremendous influence on the OKW and the Army. These
words, without any presentation of concrete facts, are only a phrase
in the mouth of a man who had no contact whatsoever with Keitel.
They are refuted by the statements of Reich Marshal Göring,
Admiral Dönitz, and Admiral Raeder. Jodl has defined this statement
as merely a figure of speech.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Insofar as the witness speaks of his tremendous influence on the
OKW, it must appear questionable what he really means. Naturally,
Keitel as Chief of Staff had influence in the OKW, influence which
resulted from his position, which I have already discussed. His
position in relation to his subordinates will be taken up later. The
<span class='pageno' title='649' id='Page_649'></span>
important thing, however, is whether Keitel had a decisive and
culpable influence on what happened. That this was not the case
has even been confirmed by Gisevius, and also the fact that he had
no decisive influence on the branches of the Armed Forces; it has
also been established by the results of the testimony.</p>

<p class='pindent'>A particularly damaging charge against the Defendant Keitel
was “that instead of placing himself in front of his subordinate
officers to protect them, he threatened to hand them over to the
Gestapo.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In contradiction to this it has been established that no chief of
office in the OKW was dismissed in the years up to 1944; furthermore,
until 20 July 1944, the day of the attempt on Hitler’s life and
the transfer of the judicial power in the home Army to Himmler,
no officer of the OKW was turned over to the Police. Admiral
Dönitz has confirmed that the branches of the Armed Forces and the
OKW were very scrupulous in maintaining the privileges of the
Armed Forces in relation to the Police.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The Court has also seen here how General Jodl spoke about his
relationship to the Defendant Keitel. I think this remark has a
special importance, not only because Keitel lived on companionable
and friendly terms with his official subordinate, General Jodl,
during their long years of co-operation. As natural as that may
appear, the less natural it is if one reflects that Jodl, in spite of his
officially subordinate position, in reality became more and more
Hitler’s sole strategic adviser. What this means, considering the
preponderance of the operational tasks in the war, has been convincingly
demonstrated here by General Jodl.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Keitel accepted this without jealousy, freely acknowledging the
superiority of his subordinate Jodl in this domain, this proves that
Keitel possessed a trait of character which refutes the information
derived from obscure sources by the witness Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The proven fact that Keitel lived on friendly and companionable
terms with his subordinate Chief of Office, Canaris, is also in
contrast with the assertion to the contrary by the witness Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection it is necessary to refer to the fact, not submitted
by Keitel but testified to by Jodl without Keitel’s consent,
that the latter supported and helped Canaris’ family after his arrest.
I only refer to this to refute the perhaps most serious personal
reproach, according to which Keitel did not behave decently toward
his subordinates and abused his superior position—which was
especially powerful in military life—even to the point of threatening
them with violence.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In reality, according to Gisevius’ evidence, Admiral Canaris not
only played a double role officially, but also with respect to the
Defendant Keitel; in exploiting the friendship shown to him he
<span class='pageno' title='650' id='Page_650'></span>
expressed a similar attitude, whereas among his own group he
openly spoke in a spiteful way about Keitel.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Finally, in this connection reference must still be made to the
evidence of the witness Von Buttlar-Brandenfels (Session of 8 May
1946) from which it is clear that Keitel always treated the officers of
the Armed Forces Operations Staff kindly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>The witness mentions a quarrel between himself and Lieutenant
Colonel Ziervogel on the one hand and Himmler on the other, in
which Keitel, to whom the incident was reported, immediately and
energetically intervened in writing to protect his subordinates
against Himmler. The affidavit of the Chief of Office in Canaris’
office, Admiral Bürckner, to which I refer, testifies in the same way
to Keitel’s kindly attitude toward his subordinates. At any rate, it
must be said in clarification that Keitel many times had occasion to
speak energetically to his office and department chiefs.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I shall then continue by explaining that officers did not generally
concern themselves with politics, and that only when the situation
became worse did they make political information the subject of
their argumentation. And I add that Keitel has, in fact, defined his
attitude with words based on the assumption that the soldier in war
must declare his faith and obedience, and if Keitel ever heard
anything about such matters, he would reprimand these officers.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Dr. Gisevius himself has said here that it was strictly forbidden for officers
to concern themselves with political questions. The Defendant Keitel has stated
that Hitler several times categorically declared the politicians were not allowed
to concern themselves with military questions because they knew nothing of
them; neither were the generals allowed to concern themselves with politics,
because they knew nothing about that either.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Hitler’s fundamental attitude in this question is shown in the decree dating
from 1936, or the winter 1936-37, by which political reports to or for the Armed
Forces were prohibited.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In logical execution of Führer Order Number 1, Hitler not only wanted an
absolute separation of the fields of activity, but also that no office should ever
be informed of the proceedings in another office. It was only a logical consequence
that Hitler strictly prohibited any discussion of political questions by
officers, and that the Defendant Keitel, while carrying out this prohibition which
he himself approved, charged his officers, when there was reason to do so, to
refrain from such discussions.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>It is obvious that this was not a question of an academic discussion of
political problems, but of an attitude revealing itself as negative toward the
position of the Supreme Commander of the Armed Forces. As long as there
were successes, there was no question of this. After Stalingrad one could hear
expressions of opinion, which at that time were characterized by Keitel as the
expressions of a weak nature.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>In accordance with his fundamental attitude that a soldier in wartime should
show unconditional and natural loyalty toward his people and fatherland as
represented by the head of the State and Supreme Commander of the Armed
Forces (and to an extreme degree when reverses set in), Keitel was actually ruthless
in condemning such expressions. He did not wish even to cause the impression
that he was of a different opinion than his superior, that he personally
had fears.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='651' id='Page_651'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I now continue at the bottom of Page 19:</p>

<p class='pindent'>Keitel did this with “words.” That does not mean that this was
mere camouflage which did not reflect his inner attitude, but it does
mean that the manner, perhaps often rough and harsh, in which the
Defendant Keitel spoke to his officers, more than once led to an
officer being punished or disciplined.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Dr. Gisevius, however, perhaps wanted to suggest that Keitel
had dealt with his subordinates in the OKW in a morally reprehensible
way.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>He did not know the Defendant Keitel personally and therefore cannot give
a personal opinion; he had to rely on the information of officers who were
strongly opposed to Keitel, without such opposition ever becoming apparent. No
one ever contacted Keitel to entice him to join in the conspiracy. That is plausible
since the conspirators, knowing the character and the soldierly attitude
of Keitel, could not expect any success. Since on the other hand Keitel was
completely innocent, which does not need to be proved, the following situation
results:</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Keitel knew nothing of conspiratorial activities; what he did encounter
appeared in the shape of technical objections or personal remarks which were
dealt with by Keitel officially and in a cordial manner, as by a superior of whom
the subordinates say that he barks but does not bite. On the other side the
so-called conspirators had to consider everyone a foe who was not in favor of
their own aim. Every move and every word was weighed and critically judged.
As every conspirator hopes for the success of his revolutionary activities he has
to gather evidence for the coming reckoning. This is, of course, a task for a
future police minister and home secretary.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>From an impartial estimation of the facts, verified by the evidence
presented, it is shown that the accusations arising from the
testimony of the witness Gisevius are not correct. But the picture
would not be complete if light were not thrown on the personality
of the witness Gisevius by his own evidence. This judgment is made
up from two factors:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) The career and the position of the witness.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) The trustworthiness of his information.</p>

<p class='pindent'>On Page 92 of my text I have stated in detail the functions
Dr. Gisevius carried out. I have not emphasized anything which,
from my point of view, might impeach him in any way for having
given the evidence here which you all have heard. I have only
impartially confirmed the following:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) He evaded military service through falsified papers put at
his disposal by Oster.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) He lived in Germany during the whole time from 1933
without restriction of liberty, and remained in office up to
20 July 1944.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(c) He was an official of the German Reich and was in its pay
from the middle of 1937 to the beginning of 1939 with the exception
of leave.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(d) He was Vice Consul of the Reich in Switzerland from 1943 in
the Consulate General at Zürich, placed there through Canaris as
<span class='pageno' title='652' id='Page_652'></span>
intelligence agent, and was naturally paid for it. At the same time
he was in touch with the enemy’s intelligence service.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(e) He had since 1933, when he worked in the Gestapo, exact
knowledge of all the horrible happenings and knew what consequences
could arise there for the German people.</p>

<p class='pindent'>(f) A special circumstance, which shows the witness Dr. Gisevius
in his true light, is the advice, or the suggestion, which he gave to
the experienced bank specialist, Dr. Schacht, that he should allow
inflation to set in and thus get the control of matters into his own
hands. This suggestion leaves only two possibilities: either complete
ignorance of the national economic importance and social
effect of an inflation, or else a boundless unscrupulousness which
completely disregards the fate of employees and workmen. An
inflation brought about knowingly can be described only as a crime
against the people. Schacht described it as a catastrophe. Schacht
answered him, according to the record: “You want the catastrophe;
I want to avoid it.”</p>

<p class='pindent'>In order to judge the reliability of the statements by the witness
Gisevius before this Tribunal, I must refer to the book submitted
by the witness as evidence: <span class='it'>To the Bitter End</span>. This book is also a
“statement” of the witness Gisevius.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To err is human, but when in the year 1945, after the collapse
of Germany, a book appears in which facts and occurrences are
presented of historical and, for those personally involved, of moral
and even criminal importance, the incorrectness of which has become
obvious in the meantime, then the error is unforgivable and
reference to false information is no longer an excuse.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Of the many inaccuracies contained in this book I will only point
out briefly the four which were established before this Tribunal
through the cross-examination by Dr. Kubuschok, which refer to the
Defendant Von Papen, and I beg you to take official, cognizance of it.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(1) Dr. Gisevius has asserted in his book that Von Papen did not resign notwithstanding
the events of 30 June 1934. It is established that Von Papen did resign
and that the public announcement was simply contemplated to be made at a
later date.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(2) Dr. Gisevius asserted further that Von Papen took part in the Cabinet
meeting which he describes with exact details and when the law was resolved
that the measures taken on 30 June 1934 were correct in the interest of the State.
Actually Von Papen has never taken part in this meeting.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(3) Dr. Gisevius asserted finally that Von Papen went to see Von Hindenburg,
but had not raised a sufficient protest against the measures. Actually what
happened was that the attempts of Von Papen to visit Von Hindenburg were
frustrated, therefore he failed to see him.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(4) The assertion in the book of Dr. Gisevius that Von Papen took part in
the meeting of the Reichstag in which the measures of 30 June were approved,
must equally be labeled incorrect information.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>It could not be termed an unfounded reproach if such a statement
were to be described as dubious and the author as unreliable. It is
<span class='pageno' title='653' id='Page_653'></span>
difficult for me as a German defense counsel to deal calmly with
this problem. The statement of Gisevius reveals the entire tragedy of
the German people. It is for me a proof of the weakness and of the
decadence of certain German circles, who played with the idea of
revolt and high treason without any feeling for the distress of the
people. They were a higher level of future ministers and generals
without the backing of the large masses of our people, the working
classes, as Reich Minister Severing has declared here very clearly.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. Justice Jackson has used the word “resistance movement”
in connection with the examination of the witness Gisevius. We
have often heard during the progress of this Trial about dauntless,
brave men and women, who fought for their country, and have
suffered and died for it. They were our enemies. But no one who
tries to judge these things impartially would deny them acknowledgment
of their heroism. But where do you find this heroism in
the group around Gisevius? If one has read his book <span class='it'>To the Bitter
End</span> and has heard him here, one looks in vain for a readily
self-sacrificing man. Even the late deed of a Stauffenberg lacks
heroism, because it lacked the resolution of self-sacrifice. Gisevius,
up to 1938—when there might still have been time to succeed in
holding back the wheel of fate—always speaks about negotiations,
conferences; but all these men wished the others, that is, the
generals, to act. If one considers the knowledge of affairs which
Gisevius had as member of the Gestapo, and all his friends had;
if one takes into account the realization of the great danger hovering
over the people—then the decision to take action should not have
been in doubt for an instant for patriotic men, as the members of
the group claimed themselves to be. But what did they do? When
the leaders of the army hesitated or refused, they did not think of
taking action themselves, but turned to the foreign countries.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>One would have full understanding for those Germans who were treated
in an outrageous manner or who had been thrown out by the Government,
particularly when they had no means or ways to undertake direct action. But
the Gisevius group had such means and possibilities. Men in the most influential
key positions, men in the OKW, in Hitler’s closest circle, belonged to them;
men who had the possibility to get close to Hitler and to his evil men behind
the scenes. Not one of them mustered up courage for action when there was
time. What did they do instead? They remained in office, they helped effectively
so as to allow crimes such as led to this Trial to be committed.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>I should not like to leave any doubt that the fact of the conspiracy
in itself is of no importance in the question of credibility to
be discussed here. Whoever is a conspirator out of pure motives,
who risks his life, in the full realization of the danger which
threatens his country, is not only clean, but also deserves the
gratitude of the fatherland.</p>

<p class='pindent'>If Gisevius and his friends, who owing to their positions were
informed about everything which most Germans only learned of in
<span class='pageno' title='654' id='Page_654'></span>
all its horror through this Trial, had served their country in
unselfish sacrifice, then perhaps we and the whole world would
have been spared much distress and suffering.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Admiral Dönitz, who knew Admiral Canaris, the source of
information, well, said:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“During the time that he was in the Navy, Admiral Canaris
was an officer in whom little trust was placed. He was altogether
different from us. We said that he had seven sides to
his character.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>But, Gentlemen, what does Dr. Gisevius say about Canaris on
Page 319 of the book <span class='it'>To the Bitter End</span>?</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“The successor was Canaris, at that time captain in the Navy,
quite clever and more cunning than Himmler and Heydrich
put together.”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>On the subsequent pages I have analysed those personalities who
have been quoted by Gisevius as being the chief sources of information.
I do not wish to go into this in any more detail. We are
concerned here with the persons of Canaris, Nebe, and Thomas.</p>

<p class='pindent'>As regards Pages 96 to 103, I shall make the following brief
summary. With reference to Canaris, I only want to say that he was
living in the closest touch and was very friendly with Himmler,
Heydrich, and the Gestapo, although he was supposed to be their
sworn enemy. Thomas, who was also allegedly a member of the
group from the beginning, was an excellent General Staff officer,
and he was an exemplary organizer and untiring worker in the
Army Economic Staff under Keitel and later in the Army Economic
Armament Staff in the High Command of the Army; you know his
publication, 2353-PS. This man was the spirit and the driving power
behind rearmament which he, as well as Keitel and others, considered
necessary to the extent which he energetically pursued. But
he is also the same man who organized the “Barbarossa-Oldenburg
Plan” and who later, under the Four Year Plan, became the head
of the economic staff of the Plan Oldenburg. The results of that
plan need not be explained here by me.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was General Thomas who, according to very convincing outward
appearances, used all his powers for the economic direction of
the war, and who, after leaving Speer’s division, was not dismissed
but was assigned by Keitel to work with the records office so that
he could write the book which forms the main point of the Indictment
with regard to rearmament. If what Gisevius has said about
Thomas is true, then since 1933 he played a double game, and was
an opportunist and not a man who can be expected to give impartial
information.</p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>The figure of Canaris is almost mystical. This is probably necessarily the
case with men who concern themselves with matters which cannot stand the</span>
<span class='pageno' title='655' id='Page_655'></span>
<span style='font-size:smaller'>clear light of day. His position was of great importance for the entire conduct
of the war. It is clear that such people must have to the highest degree the
confidence of both the political and military leaders. One can judge by the
amount of confidence which somebody enjoys whether he is trustworthy. He
also enjoyed the confidence of the Defendant Keitel, with whom, as is proven,
he associated in a friendly and companionable way, and not only as a subordinate
with his superior. Jodl declared that Keitel was much too trusting.
Can one believe that such a condition existed for years if Keitel dealt with
the alleged reports of Canaris, as the witness Gisevius has testified here, or
if he could even have received an order to commit murder from Keitel, as
Lahousen would have us believe in the cases of Generals Weygand and Giraud?</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Now if Canaris enjoyed such great confidence with Hitler and Keitel, but
at the same time also worked authoritatively in Gisevius’ group, his character
must not only be considered dual, but unreliable and untrustworthy as well.
It is understandable that a person might temporarily display such a dual nature,
if it is done for the sake of a higher aim, to serve one’s country, to liberate
it from a tyrant. However, one searches here in vain for such a serious aim,
for a deed which makes the unlawful action appear in a light of greater moral
right.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Canaris believed that he could satisfy his revolutionary duty by expressing
doubts in the circle of his trusted political associates and raising the severest
kind of criticism. He waited, like others, for the generals to act—as an admiral
he apparently did not count himself in this circle—while he himself cultivated
his confidential relations with Hitler and Keitel. According to the testimony
of the witness Gisevius, one must assume that he permitted his political associates
to establish contacts abroad.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>When did Canaris tell the truth? He was necessarily entangled in falsehood.
Did he not have to tell his political associates something, which, in the opinion
of the group, looked like activity? Did he not also have to report on what he
supposedly had told Keitel? He is the typical example of an overrefined, highly
intelligent drawing-room conspirator, protected by the nature of his obscure
activity, which to a large extent could not be checked, in whom however the
spirit of action was lacking.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Keitel had such confidence in Canaris, and such a liking for him, that he
again and again ignored Jodl’s various warnings and even until after 20 July 1944
maintained his confidence in Canaris.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Although Canaris was the most bitter enemy of the Gestapo, he worked, certainly
not out of conviction, closely and on an astonishingly friendly basis with Himmler
and Heydrich. There existed a certain competition; Himmler also had a central
intelligence office, which at first concentrated on the domestic sphere, although
later, step by step, it expanded abroad. The Defendant Kaltenbrunner testified
that this competition carried with it a possibility of friction, which, in view of
Himmler’s thirst for power, with which Canaris also was familiar, might easily
lead to the Counterintelligence Department becoming integrated into the Reich
Security Main Office (RSHA). Canaris saw himself and the circle of conspirators
endangered. He therefore did something very clever in organizing co-operation,
with the result that Himmler covered him in various dubious affairs. For a
long time this co-operation functioned well, until the Oster case and the Ankara
case afforded the RSHA’s foreign intelligence service, organized by Kaltenbrunner,
an opportunity to discredit the Counterintelligence of the OKW so strongly that
Hitler decreed the transfer of the Counterintelligence Department. What is important
in this connection is the fact of Himmler’s particular co-operation with
Canaris, and the ensuing consequence, resulting with compelling logic, that
Canaris at no time could have presented a report which would have seriously
incriminated Himmler and his organizations. For if Canaris had presented such
a written order to Keitel, he either would have had to refer the report to
Hitler or inquire from Himmler and the RSHA respectively. In both cases Himmler
would have become informed. The consequence would have been clear.
Co-operation would have become enmity, and enmity with Himmler meant the
greatest danger for Canaris and his group. I believe that this compelling logic
is stronger than any account by the witness Gisevius which concerns itself with
alleged statements by Canaris.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Such was the versatility of character in a man whom one may judge at
will, but who was neither a conspirator nor can lay claim to credibility.</span>
<span class='pageno' title='656' id='Page_656'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>For an opinion on the character and credibility of General Thomas, the
following documents are important: Document 2353-PS (Green File), Document
EC-270 and Document EC-271.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>(1) Document 2353-PS, entitled “Part A: Work done in the fields of war
economy and armaments industry until the beginning of mobilization in 1939”
was presented by the Prosecution to prove rearmament. It does furnish this
proof, which is not being denied by the Defendant Keitel.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>After being taken prisoner, Thomas made a declaration in reference to this
work of his which says that after 20 July 1944 he revised his rather critical
memorandum on the rebuilding of German war economy in such a manner that
in case of need, that is, in proceedings before a German court, it might serve
in his defense.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>His declaration, which precedes and is attached to Document 2353-PS, is
either untrue, in which case it cannot be presented as evidence by the Prosecution,
or it is true, thereby raising the question of the credibility of this immediate
witness as a source of information for Dr. Gisevius.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>On the whole, the memorandum is true. It is also true, however, that Thomas
wholeheartedly co-operated not only in rearmament but also in the organization
Oldenburg, that is, in economic preparation for war against the U.S.S.R. I refer
to Exhibit USA-141 (conversation of 29 April 1941).</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Purpose of the meeting: Introduction to organizational reconstruction of the
economic sector of the Barbarossa-Oldenburg Plan. There it says:</span></p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p><span style='font-size:smaller'>“He”—the Reich Marshal—“has delegated the task to an economic leadership
staff headed by the Chief of the Wirtschafts-Rüstungsamt (Economy
and Armaments Office) (Thomas).”</span></p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>For this task General Thomas thereby became attached to the Reich Marshal
as the chief of this entire undertaking. As explained in Keitel’s affidavit (Document
Book 2, Exhibit Number K-11), Thomas prepared and directed the entire
organizational construction of the undertaking.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>Is this consonant with the contention of Gisevius, and now also of Thomas,
that on principle they were opposed to war, and with their convinced attitude
against Hitler? The task which Thomas assumed and organized was unmistakably
incompatible with valid international law. At no time did he protest against
assumption of this office. The attitude of General Thomas can also be ascertained
from Document EC-270, submitted by the Prosecution on 6 May 1946. It is
the draft of a letter written on 27 April 1938 by the War Economy Staff (Chief
General Thomas), addressed to Department L (National Defense within the Armed
Forces Operations Staff); it is not signed by the Defendant Keitel. This involves
the struggle for power by Plenipotentiary (GBW) Funk, and Göring as the
Delegate of the Four Year Plan. Document EC-271 shows that the aim of General
Thomas was to place the entire war economy under the supervision of OKW,
that is, under the War Economy Staff which he headed. Under the guise of an
interpretation of the decree of 4 February 1938 on “direction of German armament”
he attempted to prevent Funk’s subordination to Field Marshal Göring
as Delegate of the Four Year Plan; at the same time he also wanted to prevent
the plenipotentiary from becoming independent. It was “to be established” (Page 5
of the document, last paragraph of the communication) “that in all questions
pertaining to the Armed Forces’ supplies, the plenipotentiary was to carry out
the instructions of OKW.”</span></p>

<p class='pindent'><span style='font-size:smaller'>This plan did not succeed; nor did Keitel approve it. But from Document
EC-270, with special reference to Figures 1 to 9 (Pages 2 to 4) it follows that the
endeavor of General Thomas was to extend the scope of his office to that of
a General Staff on Economics within the OKW, a plan which Thomas had been
pursuing for years already, in opposition to Keitel and Jodl; he is the man,
an opportunist and a double-dealer, who claims to have fought against methods
he terms corrupt and contrary to international law. The Defendant Keitel admits
that Thomas made reports pointing to the scarcity of raw materials; he expressed
doubts as to whether armaments would suffice to carry on a war. But these
doubts were shared by the generals, especially by Keitel. Generaloberst Jodl
confirmed the fact that such reports were submitted to Hitler and Thomas, so
that Dr. Gisevius’ contention is proved incorrect in that respect too.</span></p>

<p class='pindent'>But it is worst of all with friend Nebe. The witness Gisevius has
described Nebe as one of his most intimate friends who held the
<span class='pageno' title='657' id='Page_657'></span>
same views as he did. According to the statements of Dr. Gisevius,
Nebe had been his friend since 1933 and was thoroughly familiar
with the views of the witness. He remained in the RSHA—an
organization discussed from many angles here—until 20 July 1944,
and in the year 1944 he was in charge of the headquarters of the
Special Service (Sonderdienst) for the prevention of the escape of
prisoners of war. This is shown by Document USSR-413 submitted
by the Prosecution.</p>

<p class='pindent'>To describe this witness—from whom Dr. Gisevius, after leaving
the Gestapo, claims to have received important information continuously—it
should be pointed out that from 1933 to 1944 Nebe
served in the RSHA, evidently to the satisfaction of his superiors
Himmler, Heydrich, and Kaltenbrunner—otherwise he would not
have stayed in office so long and would not have been promoted to
the rank of Police General and SS-Gruppenführer.</p>

<p class='pindent'>So while on the one hand for 11 years he carried out the duties
of his office with the well-known methods of the Gestapo—which
was under Himmler—and later the Kripo, Dr. Gisevius refers to
him as his friend and staunch political associate. Now it might be
assumed, perhaps, that in the position he held he was able to prevent
disaster, possibly even to hold up execution of orders. Document
USSR-413, just referred to, shows that Nebe did not do this.
In the deposition by Wielen, forming part of the document, the
horrible case of the 50 escaped R.A.F. fliers, in which General Nebe,
the friend of Dr. Gisevius, was involved, is dealt with.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Wielen states as follows in this connection:</p>

<div class='blockquote'>

<p>“One day during that time I received, about noon, an order
by telegraph from General Nebe to proceed to Berlin immediately,
to be entrusted with a confidential order. Arriving in
Berlin on the evening of that day, I reported to General Nebe
at his office, Wendischer Markt 5-7. I gave him a condensed
report on the position of the matter at that time. He then
showed me a teletype order signed by Kaltenbrunner, to the
effect that, in conformity with the Führer’s explicit and
personal order, more than half of the officers who escaped
from Sagan were to be shot when recaptured. General Nebe
himself seemed shocked at this order. He was deeply worried.
I heard later that he did not go to bed that night, but spent
the night on his sofa in his office. I myself was likewise
shocked at this frightful step which was to be taken, and
refused to carry it out. I said it violated rules of war and
undoubtedly was bound to result in reprisal measures against
those of our own officers who were in English camps as
prisoners of war, and that I flatly refused to take any responsibility
in the matter. General Nebe declared that in this
<span class='pageno' title='658' id='Page_658'></span>
instance I would not be in any way responsible as the State
Police was to act entirely independently, and that, after all,
orders given by the Führer had to be executed without
protest.</p>

<p>“<span style='font-size:smaller'>Nebe furthermore added that naturally it was my duty to keep the
matter in deepest secrecy, and that the reason for his showing me the
original order was so that I would make no trouble for the State Police.</span>”</p>

</div>

<p class='pindent'>Any comment seems superfluous. This is significant of Nebe’s
personality. The trustworthiness of a person is an inseparable part
of his entire personality. Information obtained from a person who
for more than a decade was able to play such an abominable double
role can lay no claim to credibility.</p>

<p class='pindent'>I believe that this analysis of the statements of the witness
Dr. Gisevius and of the men belonging to the Gisevius group gives
me the right to say that the charges made against the Defendant
Keitel by the witness can be no suitable foundation for the argument
of the Prosecution, namely, that the Defendant Keitel</p>

<p class='pindent'>(1) formed a circle around Hitler;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(2) had tremendous influence on the OKW and the Armed Forces;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(3) did not submit reports on atrocities and crimes to Hitler; and</p>

<p class='pindent'>(4) did not protect his subordinates, but even threatened them
with the Gestapo.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Rather is it true that the real position of Keitel, however important
it may have seemed to outsiders, was neither decisive nor of
importance either for the total sum of events or for the basic and
important decisions of Hitler. Justice can be done to the actual
importance of this activity if one says that it was tremendous,
because physically and spiritually it went beyond human strength;
because it placed the defendant perpetually in a dilemma between
his military point of view and the unbending will of Hitler to whom
he was faithfully, far too faithfully, devoted. Physically it presented
an almost insoluble problem, for it had no sharply defined, clear
outline but called for the perpetual balancing of essential differences;
the adjustment of personal sensitiveness; the “self-protection”
against encroachments of the individual offices among themselves or
against the OKW; clever maneuvering when Hitler, in explosive
reaction to disagreeable news, wished to issue extravagant orders;
the settlement of all disagreeable matters which Hitler did not wish
to attend to himself.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It was a tremendously thankless task, which found only very
slight compensation in the brilliant position in the immediate
proximity to the head of the State, in the decorative participation
in all events of what is called world history, in the representative
discharge of the duties of a field marshal.
<span class='pageno' title='659' id='Page_659'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>This evidence does not appear convincing if it is intended to
prove that Keitel also actively participated in the political conversations.
When the Defendant Keitel took part in State visits and
conversations with foreign statesmen, he did not participate in the
conversations, although present. Hitler liked to have Keitel in his
entourage as the representative of the Armed Forces. Thus, Keitel
was present at Godesberg when Prime Minister Chamberlain went
there, also at Munich on 30 September 1938, and at the visit of
Molotov in November 1940. He was also present at the meetings of
Hitler with Marshal Pétain, General Franco, King Boris, Regent
Von Horthy, and Mussolini. This function of Keitel is, however,
insufficient to make the defendant a general who must have taken
a decisive part in the shaping of political events.</p>

<p class='pindent'>How little this assertion is justified is seen from the fact testified
to by Admiral Bürckner that Keitel was extremely careful not to
encroach on the affairs of the Foreign Office and gave his officers
orders not to engage in matters referring to foreign policy. In
domestic politics the exclusion of the Chief of the OKW resulted
from the removal of the Reich War Minister, already dealt with,
and the thereby intended and achieved elimination of political
representation of the Armed Forces in the Cabinet.</p>

<p class='pindent'>It is obvious, and has also already been pointed out, that the
position of the Defendant Keitel as Chief of the OKW involved, and
in time of war to an increased extent, his coming into some kind of
contact with all the ministries and highest offices, and dealing with
them as the representative of the OKW, that is to say, of Hitler.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That did not make Keitel a politician, that is to say, a man who
took part in an advisory capacity in the determination of the
Government’s aims, and had an influence on them. In his high
office he naturally worked to carry out these aims and bears a
responsibility to that extent, but not as a political general.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Mr. President, I am now beginning a long chapter. Do you want
me to start with it?</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Go on reading then until 5 o’clock.</p>

<p class='pindent'>DR. NELTE: The idea of war against Russia was rejected by
Keitel. This found visible expression in the memorandum which
Field Marshal Keitel drew up, discussed with Von Ribbentrop, and
handed over to Hitler. According to his sworn statements the reasons
were:</p>

<p class='pindent'>(a) military considerations;</p>

<p class='pindent'>(b) the Nonaggression Pact with the Soviet Union dated 23 August
1939.
<span class='pageno' title='660' id='Page_660'></span></p>

<p class='pindent'>In spite of being personally presented, the memorandum had
no success. Hitler, as usual in questions of strategic nature, rejected
Keitel’s point of view as unconvincing.</p>

<p class='pindent'>In this connection, and owing to Hitler’s curt rejection, Keitel
asked for release and transfer to the front. This is the case which
Reich Marshal Göring confirmed in his interrogation. Hitler refused,
sharply criticizing the habit of generals asking to be released or
tendering their resignation whenever he did not approve their
opinions or suggestions.</p>

<p class='pindent'>That was decisive for Keitel: he remained at his post, did his
duty, and fulfilled his obligations in carrying out the tasks incumbent
upon him within the framework of further preparations. Here,
too, in keeping with his conception of duty, Keitel did not make
known to the outside world his basically negative attitude toward
the war with Russia, after Hitler had made his decision.</p>

<p class='pindent'>This case is in several respects typical of Keitel and of the way
he is judged by others. We know—and it has been proved by the
evidence—that other generals were also opposed to war with the
Soviet Union. Their objections, too, were waived or rejected by
Hitler. They, too, accepted the decision of the Supreme Commander
of the Armed Forces, continued to do their duty and carried out the
orders given to them. But there was one basic difference: these
other generals went back to their headquarters after the discussion.
There, in their own circle of officers they spoke about the decision
made by Hitler. Of course it was disputed, yet they acted in accordance
with it.</p>

<p class='pindent'>Since Field Marshal Keitel, due to his military conception, as
already depicted, did not make known to the generals, when they
appeared in the Führer’s headquarters for discussions, what his
own attitude was, which was also at variance, the impression was
bound to arise that Field Marshal Keitel completely agreed with
Hitler and did not support the scruples of the Armed Forces’
branches.</p>

<p class='pindent'>THE PRESIDENT: Dr. Nelte, I think you might stop there.</p>
